University of Newcastle,NU,"Architecture, Planning and Landscape",Planning Contexts,20,Dr Alexander Wilson,"This module introduces the hybridity of the planning context - political, economic, legal, others, and reflects on how planning is an expression of these different dimensions, and articulates its purposes utilising these framings. It introduces students to these contexts’ particular foundations and considerations and it utilises these disciplines, mechanisms and modes of operating to accommodate environmental and societal challenges (such as climate change, healthy living, etc.), and reflects on how planners, developers and designers have to respond to these different demands and accommodate these challenges in the proposals they produce.",,,,,,"Students will be introduced to key ideas through a lecturing format this will include introducing students to hybrid nature of planning, reflecting on its legal, political, economic, social framing, and how this shapes Planning’s ability to plan. This will then be applied through the lectures/workshop sessions to explore how these ideas occur in practice. Some content will be provided using online material ahead of the session.",The first assignment enables the students to reflect critically on the hybrid nature of the planning context and the second assignment enables students to consider how planning tackles significant societal challenges through the policy or development approval processes.,https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/apl/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"Architecture, Planning and Landscape",Participation: Theories & Practice,20,Mrs Armelle Tardiveau,"This module aims to get you to:
a.        Develop a critical appreciation of the contexts for participation and the possibilities for action that these can create.
b.        Explore and understand the traditions of participation theories that can be drawn upon to promote engagement activity, considering methodologies, actors involved, organisational and delivery requirements that these might generate. 
c.        Critically reflect on the value of one participatory approach or theme in its application to a chosen case study, considering the aims of the project the procedures used, the project outputs and the impact that it has generated in terms of it achieving its aims.
d.        Develop your skills of critical analysis of the narrative that supports a participatory approach, with a focus on one approach in particular.
e.    Develop skills in preparing and designing participatory processes within the limitations of the project case study and any extension of it. 
f.      Reflect on the value of the chosen methodologies for a wider audience/ for wider architectural, planning or creative practice.


Themes introduced will include amongst others: Collaborative planning, participatory design, the activist approach, co-production and design – collective making, collective learning, etc.",,,,,,"Initial lectures contextualise the theory that creates the framework for various participatory processes. Students will then choose one of the project themes that have emerged from the theory and will then undertake a close examination of its key principles with reference to an appropriate case study and relevant academic literature. Group research and pilot project, along with private study will promote an in-depth understanding of participatory processes and how different methodologies have been applied.  Group workshops and tutorials will support the students through this learning to a point where they are able to share their findings through to group presentation and individual essay.

Should the public health situation not allow for present in person teaching, the core content will be delivered through pre-recorded content and synchronous sessions, including weekly live online module talks, tutorials and drop-ins. The pre-recorded lecture materials will be complemented by learning activities as well as synchronous Q&A sessions.","Assignment One
Group presentation showcasing learning from the case study and related academic literature, in front of peer audience. Students need to demonstrate an understanding of participatory approaches and theories relevant to the case study, be able to unpack the key elements of the participatory process and reflect on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the approach. 

Assignment Two
Group pilot study report that highlights the concerns of the City Actor and the recommended approach to engaging with them in addressing these concerns, drawing on learning to date (2000 words)

Assignment Three
An individual essay reflecting on the appropriate participation theory in the context of the case study and how it has been informed by the pilot study (1500 words).",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/apl/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"Architecture, Planning and Landscape",Alternative Practice: Co-producing Space,20,Mr Daniel Mallo,"Alternative Practice: Co-producing Space explores the role of the socially engaged spatial practitioner in community-led place making. Through a semester long enquiry, students will work on a live project and engage with a real community aiming to understand, through first-hand experience, how people relate to places (their experience, stories, narratives) and how places can enhance sociability, connectedness and the desire of appropriation through different activities. The module asks students to engage in a participatory approach (drawing from APL2035) through a temporary intervention conceived as means of testing and trying new urban experiences and narratives. The delivery of the intervention will provide a physical setting for probing the future: a form of enactment that intensifies and invests a space with new dynamics, allowing new socio-spatial interactions. Through the process, students will be required to develop a critical approach as reflective practitioners, and engage in a learning process that revolves around knowing and doing in a continuous process of reflection-in-action.

Module aims:

•        To facilitate a community project or intervention.
•        To apply theories, histories, case studies and approaches learnt through the alternative practice and related modules.
•        To situate the community project in relation to arguments for intervention in the built environment and an understanding of processes for change and the role of professionals and others in achieving it.
•        To demonstrate an understanding of the complexities of issues and problems pertaining to co- production in the built environment.",,,,,,"Initial lecture introduces the module and will be followed-up with briefings at key stages in the project. On-line group tutorials and reviews allow students to gain from staff expertise and provide opportunities to discuss their particular co-production strategy. The fieldwork and private study enable students to gain an in-depth understanding of the site (through field visits) and community/stakeholders, and to follow up evidence in relation to it. It also provides time for students to reflect on key theoretical issues related to community engagement. Students will also need to organise their time/plan future actions, meet to discuss their various activities, and draw together their strategy and presentation (Group-learning).

Should the public health situation not allow for present in person teaching, the briefing sessions will be delivered in an online synchronous mode with weekly live module talks and drop-ins. Group tutorials and project reviews will move to synchronous online delivery with the support of online design platform Miro. Fieldwork will follow public health restrictions and engagement with communities will take place remotely.

Contact hours rationale: 38 contact hours. Students work on a live project and engage with a real community, this mode of delivery of design studio requires a higher level of student support.","The co-production project addresses a real issue in a real community - usually in the North-East - and is conducted in conjunction with a community group.
Students work in groups and their work includes the design, planning, detailing and/or making of a live intervention for community engagement. This tests the students' ability to understand a community and evaluate the issues at work, as well as articulate a co-produced spatial intervention (through a range of different media including visuals, models, engagement probes or prototypes), and to reflect individually on the achievements/challenges/limitations of their engagement and/or intervention project.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/apl/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"Architecture, Planning and Landscape",Introduction to Architecture,20,Professor Katie Lloyd Thomas,"To enable students to:

Develop an awareness of the history, principles and theories of architecture, and their contribution to present and past environments.

Recognise how architecture and its composition, representation, making and materiality has been shaped by technological, social, political, economic, geographic and cultural forces, and by the principles and theories of architecture - present and past.

Understand historic works of architecture and developments in the history of ideas, science and art as part of the continuum of architectural culture within which contemporary architects operate, and to begin incorporating these into design projects.

To appreciate different modes of architectural writing and to critically communicate understanding of architectural history, principles and theory in written and graphic form, using appropriate media and academic research and referencing methods.",,,,,,"In semester 1 a mixture of scheduled and structured activities, including recorded mini lectures, reading and skills based tasks to be carried out individually and in small student groups around a theme (eg. ‘at home’, ‘architecture and power’, ‘production and exchange’) enable students to build their knowledge of architecture and develop the skills to locate and evaluate information independently. Themes can be responsive to staff specialisms and changing teaching situations and timetables. Structured activities are supported by directed and independent reading, and skills practice between module activity days, and towards the end of the semester by assessment preparation. Weekly 2 hr synchronous sessions comprise a mix of module talk, lecture and academic skills activities that can either be conducted in person and recorded in session, or if necessary transferred to a mix of online synchronous and pre-recorded talks.

In semester 2 a 4 week teaching block is more focussed on reading, researching and writing skills, preparing students for their essay submission after Easter.  Module meetings and pre-recorded mini lectures, as well as structured individual and group activities support 3 seminars in which students discuss readings and review carefully staged tasks towards their essay writing. Weekly 1 hr synchronous sessions comprise a mix of module talk and academic skills activities that can either be conducted in person and recorded in session, or if necessary transferred to a mix of online synchronous and pre-recorded talks.

Synchronous v Non-synchronous Hours: While there is both synchronous and non-synchronous learning and teaching activity for all modules, across the programme the structured guided learning is weighted towards non-design modules and the scheduled learning and teaching activity hours are weighted towards Architectural Design modules. The latter is a reflection of a) design studio pedagogy, which is centred on a dialogic and responsive approach to students’ own research and creative work and b) student feedback and high student attendance at weekly online Architectural Design Stage briefings (module talks) during the period of lockdown teaching in Spring 2020. Architectural pedagogy is reliant on a high proportion of independent learning to support the design process. The MOF hours are consistent with this approach.","The poster – or pamphlet explaining a historical walk - is produced individually and assesses student’s ability to access, and interpret information about buildings in context, to construct a narrative about relationships that demonstrates understanding of their history and significance, and to communicate their analysis and ideas using graphic techniques.  Elements of the walk are selected and researched on a weekly basis in response to themes discussed in teaching sessions, and brought together in the final submission in week 8. 

The essay (semester 2) appraises their understanding of themes introduced during the module and their capacity to consider buildings in terms of their historical and social context, and assesses their ability to produce a clearly written and illustrated essay using academic research and referencing methods.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/apl/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"Architecture, Planning and Landscape",Architectural Representation 2,10,Dr Carlos Calderon,"The aims of the module are to enable students to process, transform and communicate information.
In particular to introduce:
Digital modes and communication methods appropriate to particular circumstances and architectural tasks
Digital representation techniques  and principles for graphical and visual media
Basic  to  advanced  computing   skills   in   an architectural context
Core study and workplace computer skills
The subject area involves an ongoing increasing proportion of the syllabus as the course progresses. This module concentrates  upon  the digital skills  used in the essential process of communicating design ideas to multiple audiences.   The module draws upon the use of digital tools and methods in professional practice to exemplify effective digital communication strategies at various stages in a student’s professional development.",,,,,,"The topics are explored through lectures, presentations, demonstrations, workshops, exercises and assignments with supporting sessions. Most aspects are also demonstrated, explored and tested in workshop topics, assessments and presentations during the follow-up ARC1001 project work. 
Specifically, digital representation methods are taught using dedicated workshops, and one to one and small group tutorials. The learnt techniques are applied to communicating architectural ideas through digital media.  Workshops and tutorials complement weekly lectures where concepts are explained to support developing a digital communication strategy for architectural representation. During the lectures, academic concepts are first introduced and then supported by examples in architectural practice.
Due to uncertainties around room ventilation provision, cluster access etc, the expectation is that the delivery of the module will be blended, with workshops and larger-group teaching taking place on-line. If the provision allows, we will timetable some opportunities for building ‘attendance’ – mainly to provide opportunities for student peer-learning","A structured approach to 2D CAD drawings, 3D computer modelling, image manipulation, and rendered videos is assessed.

Develop an awareness of theories and ideas from a range of disciplines relating to architecture,
cities, space, ecologies and the production of the built environment.
Recognise how factors surrounding the practice of architecture, such as planning, regulation,
economy, diverse cultures, ways of living and thinking about the world, influence both the production
of the built environment and the values it forms and perpetuates.
Appreciate the complex interplay between architects’  designs, techniques and practices and their
theoretical approaches, principles and political aspirations (such as ecology, participation, diversity,
critique) in architectural cultures since the late 19th century to the present day.

Decisions in an ethical, responsible and adaptive manner.",,,,,,"Teaching in semester one is by means of weekly blocks 2.5 hour lecture sessions. These will be in-person, with 1 hour dedicated to subject introduction and close reading of texts led by lecturer. 1 hour will be a continuation of last years ‘zoom-interviews’ - which will take place either with an interviewed guest in conversation in person, or via zoom to the lecture theatre. This enables us to invite guests from across the world, as has happened in 2020/21, but with a live ‘in-person’ audience. This structured interview in the lecture theatre will be followed by a half hour Q+A with invited guest.

These in-person event will be supported by one hour per week of pre-recorded content that takes students on a virtual tour of a city, exploring thematic content in relation to real world examples. These will be in twenty minute sections and relate to the content of the in-person lecture and interview.

Seminars will be delivered in-person where allowed, with 1 hour per block, allowing students to explore a key thematic text with an academic colleague. 

Online discussion groups will remain, with canvas used to file and respond to lecture questions and module information as the semester progresses.

In the event of further public health measures, all of this content and student engagement can move online as in academic year 2020/21.

In semester two students follow a themed seminar series chosen from a selection on offer, that supports their emerging dissertation interests. These are research-led weekly seminars from APL staff from the range of disciplines in architecture, from humanities and social sciences to creative practice and technology. Students are expected to augment this knowledge by reading and exploring other sources of information. These are expected to move back to in-person delivery, with the use of remote learning technology where appropriate.","Essay
The essay assesses students’ overview and knowledge of the syllabus and their ability to consider the built environment in relation to some of the theories and ideas they have been introduced to, and to access and synthesise materials and evidence to support their arguments.

In recognition of the nature of the essay as an 'in-process' development tool for thinking, and not an end in itself, the assessment considers the process of developing ideas on the page: partial and positional work, open-ended propositional writing, citational practices, and the exploration of textual space and writerly modes.

You will meet with a small group of peers and a design tutor on a weekly basis during both Semester 1 and 2 in order to discuss the development of your response to project briefs. The delivery of these small group teaching sessions can take a number forms, from seminar style discussions through to more structured oral presentations. Small group teaching sessions operate as the primary teaching and learning activities of the module, aiding development of module learning learning and skills outcomes through regular dialogue with both design tutor(s) and peers.

Small group teaching activities are further supported by other scheduled learning and teaching activities including lectures, module talks, and workshops that explore related module and project themes and aid the development of both module and project specific learning and skill outcomes. 

Throughout the course of the module, you will be expected to conduct both structured guided learning and guided independent study to assist the development of a coherent and fully documented response and submission to both Semester 1 and 2 project briefs and assessments. Both structured guided learning and guided independent learning should reflect and respond to discussions and dialogue conducted during weekly scheduled learning and teaching activities with your peers, design tutor(s), module leader(s), and invited guest contributors e.g. reviewers or guest lecturers. 

Note regarding Covid-19 delivery of 'present-in-person' contact hours:

Present-in-person contact hours are provided through regular lectures (20 hours), module talks (20 hours), small group teaching sessions (66 hours), and associated academic, research, and design skills workshops (20 hours). All of this synchronous teaching can alternatively be delivered online dependent on external factors and circumstances.","Summative assessment will take place at the end Semester 2. Each project submission is awarded a final grade (0-100) that constitutes the final overall module grade.

The assessment criteria for Semester 2 project submissions are based on the learning outcomes and assessment criteria outlined in respective project briefs. The assessment criteria in all design projects broadly integrates the following expectations:

- demonstration of a considered and thorough design process offering a clear relationship to a declared design proposition.
- evidence of engagement with ethical and professional considerations that assist design decision-making.
- declaration of a design proposition.
- integration of construction design technology covering structural, material, environmental, and ecological considerations.
- application of a range of representation techniques to coherently communicate both a design process and a design proposition.

2.        Within the present context of climate emergency, the module seeks to demonstrate the relevance and impact that sustainable building technologies, constructional methods, material choices and ‘design’ in the broader sense, all have in relation to both natural and man-made environments.
3.        To introduce the idea of architectural design being about the ‘whole’ (i.e. a building that responds to a particular place and context and addresses a programmatic-based set of requirements) and that, whilst this is a common starting-point, consideration must also be given (and may sometimes commence with) the ‘parts’ (constructional materials, elements, components, junctions and details).
4.        To introduce a number of common constructional systems, with a focus on the sequence of building construction (the layering of materials within elements and the timing of when things happen) and the importance of constructional junctions and details (how and why things come together, are fixed and joined).
5.        To reinforce previously learned structural principles, to increase the understanding of structural ‘orders’, and to consider the spatial implications of different structural systems.
6.        To introduce relevant legislation, codes of practice and issues surrounding design and constructional health and safety.
7.        To highlight building and constructional realisation as being a fundamentally collaborative and group endeavour.",,,,,,"The proposal for 2021/22 is based around re-using the newly prepared video resources, along with some of the associated scaffolding activities (mainly structured research and reading), all delivered non-synchronously. The module ‘sign-posting’ talks will move to become scheduled fortnightly live ‘in-person’ sessions and in Semester 1, each of these will link to a new scheduled live ‘in-person’ Symposium session (forming a series of 4 in total). Each of the Symposium sessions will address a Climate Emergency theme and seek to relate these to the ongoing non-synchronous lecture videos and supporting research and reading – each Symposium is likely to include contributions from guest speakers (some of them remote geographically) and each will incorporate student group discussion and presentations. 

Following feedback from the current cohort, the workshop provision will be increased slightly from the 2020/21 provision, although, following very positive feedback from the staff in relation to levels of student preparation and interaction, they will continue to be delivered on-line. The supporting on-line student-led workshop preparatory sessions will also be retained.

Summary of ‘Present in person’ provision: 
The (roughly) fortnightly Module Talks and Symposiums will be scheduled live ‘in-person’ activities – a total of 14 hours across the 2 semesters.

Summary of Synchronous v Non-synchronous Hours:
There are both synchronous (24.5 hours in total across the 2 semesters) and non-synchronous (29 hours in total across the 2 semesters) Learning & Teaching Activities. The core lecture material will be delivered non-synchronously (as a series of 45 x 20 minute videos). 

Summary of Plan ‘B’ – i.e. Fall-back position in the event of future lock-downs etc:

5. Develop creative thinking and visioning, i.e. thinking outside the box, problem formulation and research and communication skills.

The module aims to introduce participants to key environmental issues and processes within the overall context of sustainable development, from the perspective of planning. The underlying principle of the module is that the “environment” must be taken into account in policy planning for sustainable development to ensure participatory and accountable decision-making in managing change and development, whilst preserving and enhancing environmental values and resources.",,,,,,"This module will be delivered via both, scheduled and structured learning activities. These include present in person lectures which will provide students with weekly contact with the module leader and with their peers, and an opportunity to ask questions, seek clarifications or expand on the discussions in an informal manner. During these sessions the portfolio of guided structured learning activities for each session will be explained, including how they relate to the module learning outcomes.  They include selected readings and participation to non-synchronous discussion boards. 

The lectures covering different topics aim to provide a conceptual background for understanding the environment and sustainable development, and the role of planning in managing (environmental) change for sustainable development. The readings provide students with the opportunity to develop a more in-depth understanding of environmental and sustainability debates within the context of policy- and plan-making, and of the challenges in doing so. The non-synchronous online discussion boards provide students with the opportunity to discuss further the complex issues explored in the lectures and in the selected readings in a structured way, to critically reflect on the interactions and tensions between the different dimensions of sustainable development, and their implications on environmental planning – with the support of independent reading. All activities aim to support and guide students in the preparation for assessed coursework. 

Should the public health situation not allow for present in person teaching, lectures will be reduced from 11 to 9, and core content will be delivered through pre-recorded content blocks, two per session of 15-30 minutes each with weekly live online module talks and drop-ins. The pre-recorded lecture materials will be complemented by learning activities which will provide students with the opportunity to reflect on the recorded material covered and explore more in-depth the topics covered by reading a selected paper, which will then be discussed as a cohort in a non-synchronous online discussion board facilitated by the module leader.

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,Fleshful Things: The Body and Visual Art,20,Dr Edward Juler,"Throughout history the human body has been as an object of fascination to artists. Our bodies act as the sensory interface between our inner selves and the world we inhabit, and it is through the body that our experience of the world is mediated and understood. Yet this apparently straightforward relationship is complex. In many ways, the body is an overdetermined cultural object, subject to a set of shifting sociocultural, psychological, aesthetic and scientific values which complicate and destabilize its status. The twentieth century experienced what has been described by historians as a ‘corporeal turn’ as advances in psychology, sexuality, anthropology, medicine and politics fundamentally transformed the sociocultural status of the body. The sustained attention paid to the body by artists in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries reflected this sociocultural shift. Not only was corporeal representation at the forefront of avant-garde practice, but, by mid-century, the body itself had become the medium as performance-based practice and video art transformed the nature of art making. This course will provide a thematic overview of the body in visual art in the period 1900-2000 by exploring corporeal representation in a variety of modern and contemporary artists, ranging from Antonin Artaud to Bill Viola.

The course will explore the diverse range of ways in which the body has been represented in visual art in the period c.1900 – 2000. It will provide a thematic approach to understanding the various ways (socio-political, medical, aesthetic and cultural) in which the body has appealed to artists, paying particular attention to the central role the body plays in artistic and cultural discourse as an object of knowledge that is an once personal and subjective yet also institutionalised and objective. The course will examine how the twentieth century revolutionised the human body and its representation. It will show how developments in politics, medicine, sexuality, technology and culture reshaped artistic interpretations of the body and its socio-cultural meanings. Students will gain an understanding of how artists use the body to express ideas about (among others) aesthetics, the self, society, healthcare and mortality. Students will also acquire knowledge of different aesthetic, historiographic, sociological and interdisciplinary approaches to studying the body in art.

Film theory encompasses questions about film’s relationship to reality and the world, to style and technique, and to politics and ideology. This module will chart out the history of ideas concerning cinema as well as discuss historical context of various film movements and film manifestos from around the world. Particular attention will be paid to filmmaker-theorists who triggered a new theoretical take or exemplified a theoretical stance.

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,"Race, Culture and Identity",20,Dr David Bates,"This module aims:
• To explore the concept of ‘race’, its historical development and contemporary significance, with a particular focus on the intersections of ‘race’, class, gender and sexuality in media, popular culture and cultural studies. 
• To develop a critical understanding of racism in its myriad forms, drawing on cultural theory to analyse the social, cultural, political and economic forces involved in the reproduction of ‘race’ and racisms.
• To consider how people and groups are ‘racialised’ through discursive and social practices (including journalism and social media), and to assess the implications of these practices for racialized groups.
• To examine how ‘racial’ ideas and practices have been resisted, culturally and politically. 

This module provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to discuss ‘race’ and racism in an informed, sensitive and critical fashion, making links between ‘race’ and other cultural identities based on class, gender and sexuality.  Drawing on theoretical perspectives developed within media and cultural studies, heritage, sociology, history, linguistics and anthropology, students will explore current debates around ‘race’, identity and popular culture through the prism of cultural theory.  They will learn about what ‘race’ is and where it comes from, and how racism can be seen as multiple, fluent and historically contingent.  Students will develop the skills to think and write about contemporary ‘race’ issues with diligence and precision, and will gain a critical understanding of the role played by media and popular culture in reproducing (and resisting) racist discourse.

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,"Sex, Sexuality and Desire",20,Dr Chris Haywood,"This module aims to develop students’ knowledge and interest in a wide range of issues and topics that surround sex, sexuality and desire. Fundamentally, the module aims to encourage students to apply a critical literacy to explore the knowledge, meanings and understandings in this area. Alongside this, it explores this field in a learning context that cultivates personal and academic development by offering intellectually exciting and challenging experiences. Furthermore, it aims to equip students with a knowledge and understanding of sex, sexuality and desire across, local and global situations and historical and contemporary contexts.  

As in the 19th and 20th centuries, ‘the sexual’ in the 21st century continues to fascinate, abhor, excite and astonish. For many societies in the northern hemisphere, sexuality has developed as a private and public erotic template that enables us to make sense of our own and others emotions, intimacies and passions. It is a form of eroticism that has, as Foucault (1980) suggests, come to designate the ‘truth of ourselves’; a conduit through which flows the essence of our human nature. On this module we argue that we are in a contemporary cultural context where finding out about sex, sexuality and desire is not simply about solving population problems, cures for sexual infections or improving our sex lives but has become a key part of our sexual selves. 

Therefore, this module reflects upon how sex, sexuality and desire are becoming central to the society we live in, the culture we consume and the self we identify with.  For example, there is a burgeoning selection of self-help guides that offer to reveal our secret sexual natures. There is also an increase in popular scientific explanations that suggest that evolution, genetics and DNA are the basis for our sexual behaviours. At the same time, popular television programmes provide ‘sex tips’ to a national audience, whilst email spam interrupts daily routines with revelations of how to optimize our sexual performances. Popular culture commends that we should all become experts in sexual knowledge and fluent in sex talk. It is in this context that the module locates itself. 

This module draws upon a wide range of perspectives and disciplines to offer students the opportunity to explore the impact of cultural contexts on some of the more intimate and private aspects of our lives. Thus, students from disciplines other than media, communication and cultural studies, will have the opportunity to draw upon their own disciplinary knowledge and understandings as well as that of existing social and cultural studies to reflect on sex, sexuality and desire.",,,,,,"The module involves different styles of teaching and learning in order to deliver the learning outcomes. The delivery of the module is based on the delivery of two-hour lectures. Supporting materials in the shape of the non-synchronous learning Sways will be provided to students fortnightly. These learning Sways may be supported by a number of different present-in-person activities that could include exploring reactions to videos, worksheet learning, unstructured drop-ins, creative practice and designing research projects. Not only are these designed to enhance student learning and reinforcement of the key ideas, themes and issues, the present-in-person activity designed to support students with the development of their portfolio assessment. The module will also offer focused support by offering an online drop-in session that will be scheduled at the end of the module. Finally,  the first three weeks provide the scaffolding for further, in-depth, discussion of sex, sexuality and desire. The module then requires students to watch a number of documentaries. These documentaries are required viewing in advance of the on-campus seminars. These documentaries will enable students to develop confidence and background understanding of a number of the themes being discussed on the module.","The essay will allow students to research and write about a specific area of sex, sexuality and desire. It is anticipated that this work will offer a detailed analysis and understanding of a variety of approaches in this area.

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,Celebrity Culture,20,Dr Gareth Longstaff,"This module aims to:
1. Enable students to develop a critical and contextual understanding of ‘celebrity culture’ within the associated fields of media, culture and communication.
2. Allow participants to develop specialisms on the basis of specific interests (e.g. celebrity identity and identification; the representational and self-representational discourses of celebrity; celebrity and psychoanalysis; social media and celebrity; cultural/political economies of celebrity; ‘fans’ and audiences; celebrity and reality; celebrity death; celebrity and politics; intersectionality and celebrity; micro- and post-celebrity culture; celebrity influence, consumption and capital).
3. Encourage students to consolidate methodological and critical skills in studying practices, texts, epistemological, qualitative and quantitative material in the spheres of celebrity culture, media, communication and cultural studies.
4. Examine the rise of celebrity culture and the role of celebrities/stars both globally and locally.
5. Investigate and understand the culturally and temporally specific nature of ‘celebrity’ and fame and to develop critical resources allied to individual case studies of specific ‘celebrities’, cultural trends and practices.

The module aims to critically and theoretically investigate the construction and consumption of celebrity in the 20th and 21st centuries. It will do so by locating and mapping the paradoxical and contingent nature of fame, public and private selves and cultural visibility. The module will situate the conflicting and contrasting notion of ‘celebrity’ alongside established versions of celebrity identity and identification. By positioning the politics of the ‘ordinary’ social sphere against the ‘extraordinary’ world of celebrity culture, it will use literature and theories from the fields of media and cultural studies, critical theory and visual culture to evaluate and bring to bear contexts and case studies.

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,Conflict and Crisis Reporting,20,Dr Florian Zollmann,"Conflicts and crises are significant features of contemporary democratic societies. How journalists and the media report on such events is crucial for public understanding and democratic decision making. Moreover, journalistic reporting has an impact on how conflicts and crises are managed by society. In fact, journalistic reporting may contribute towards conflict resolution. Building on the theoretical and practical understandings developed in stage 1, this module aims to develop students’ understanding of the societal role of journalism during times of conflict and crisis. Students will assess how ethical norms of professional journalism, such as ‘objectivity’ and ‘impartiality’, are realized when journalists report on contemporary wars, terrorist attacks or refugee crises. Furthermore, students will consider conflict and crisis reporting in the context of the political and economic organisation of the media industry and with reference to up-to-date scholarship. Additionally, students will, from a journalistic perspective, interrogate the contexts and histories of a range of contemporary conflicts and crises.  

More specifically, the module enables students:
- To analyse the relationship between journalism theory and journalistic practice in the light of conflict and crisis reporting.
- To obtain in-depth knowledge and understanding of the theories and practices of journalism in the context of national and international media reporting of conflicts and crises.  
- To build their understanding of ethical norms relevant to the media industry in order to be able to practice journalism and media work as ethical and reflexive professionals.
- To critically assess journalistic accounts of conflicts and crises in relation to theories and concepts that are relevant in media, communication and cultural studies.",,,,,,"The module interrogates the role of journalism and the media in democratic societies during times of conflict and crisis.

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,Memory Matters: Mediating Present Pasts for the Future,20,Dr Susannah Eckersley,"We live in times of an unprecedented ‘memory boom’, where conflicts over memory, memorials and commemoration are present in across society – in media and discourse as well as in heritage and memory practices. How do we remember and represent important issues from the past? What choices are made - and by whom - over what should be remembered, and what forgotten?  Who has the right to tell and the authority to be believed? Whose voices have been neglected and how are ‘memory activists’ changing this? How is memory mediated within society and culture and for what purposes? 

This interdisciplinary module aims to analyse why memory matters – to whom, when, where and how. It aims to give you tools to think about different scales and dimensions of memory; from the personal to the global, from the concrete to the virtual, from the happy to the horrific. It aims to give you the confidence to work with different theoretical, methodological and practical approaches to memory. It aims to enable you to identify relationships of power, pragmatic and utopian politics, and preoccupations with place in contemporary battles to remember, and, ultimately, to position yourself in this fascinating and contested field.",,,,,,"Interactive lectures will provide you with the theoretical and methodological framework you need to become familiar with key names and concepts in the field. When backed up with small-group teaching, where you will study the relevant literature and case studies in detail, this structure will enable you to become proficient at recognising the points of controversy and to become confident at intervening in the debates.","The assessment is planned in such a way as to allow for incremental, reflexive learning. 

The Discussion Board contributions will allow you to post on real time events that you have selected yourselves and, in doing so, to appreciate the significance of this knowledge for contemporary life; that is, why memory matters. Students will be required to contribute to this board over the course of the module, writing a minimum of 4 discussion posts responding to and reflecting on a theme or idea raised during the lecture, responding to each other’s posts and sharing examples of memory practices, debates and representations that relate to the lecture topics. This will hone student skills of constructive criticism and critical reflection within an interdisciplinary setting.The comments and responses from your peers will allow you to engage closely with the learning aims and objectives of the module and to recognise productive differences in theoretical and methodological approaches. It will also hone your skills of constructive criticism. 

The assessment methods offer students the opportunity to explore themes from the module and apply them in a theoretical and practical way. Essay 1 allows students to identify and critique theories, themes and methods discussed within the module in order to analyse different scales and dimensions of memory in relation to examples of their choice. Students will be given a list of potential essay questions, but will also be able to define their own topics in consultation with the module leader, enabling students to draw out specific interests, practices or debates that are of interest to them.

Fashion plays a huge role in the everyday lives of individuals and has been characteristic of various cultural groups/social movements and iconic of historical periods. All fashion is transmitted through advertising, promotion or communication. This module will examine the cultural relevance of fashion and the professional contexts of fashion communication in relation to the perspective of cultural studies. It will provide a critical map of the field and bring together work on fashion communication in media & cultural theory, journalism, advertising, public relations, events management and graphic/visual studies. 

Through these fields, the module will show the complex social relations between fashion, culture, markets and commercial communication. Links are made between brand aesthetics, creativity and context. Individuals consume fashion messages in various ways and locations: questions of place and identity, aesthetics and broader cultural/global practices are explored. Particular attention is given to the media and new communication technologies as points of overlap and exchange between the local and the global, between organization and culture, the individual and brand.

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,Storytelling and Collective Psychology,20,Dr Darren Kelsey,"This module focuses on storytelling and collective psychology in contemporary society. Focusing on a number of texts and contexts in media, journalism, film, politics and popular culture, you will learn how to critically analyse the archetypal conventions of storytelling and mythology by exploring and applying key concepts in collective psychology. 

Students will also develop knowledge on how myths and ideologies develop over time and how they are adapted to serve cultural and political changes in society. You will learn how myths reflect social norms, values and ideals whilst also understanding how myths cause, reinforce or replicate social conflicts and social change.

Lectures, readings and assessments will enable students to critically reflect on their own media practices as well as the work produced by other practitioners. In doing so, we will critically reflect on the role of storytelling in our personal lives, considering how these stories shape the environments in which we live. We will explore the impact that storytelling has on our personal and collective wellbeing, while considering how our collective wellbeing impacts upon stories about ourselves and others.

The module will introduce Kelsey’s (2017) discourse-mythological approach (DMA). You will learn how to use this framework and conduct psycho-discursive analysis – within the module, during future studies and in prospective professional practices. 

Students will demonstrate their own understanding of storytelling and collective psychology through interactive seminar workshops and independent research projects. In doing so, you will produce your own case study by adopting and applying your choice of concepts and approaches offered on the module.",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce literature and concepts on mythology and archetypal conventions of storytelling. Case studies presented in lectures through research-informed teaching will enhance knowledge of literature and contextual frameworks of ideology. 

Research-informed teaching will adopt Kelsey’s discourse-mythological approach and its application in order to provide students with the necessary toolkits for analysing myth and ideology, which they will adopt and build upon through their independent study and assessments. 

Lectures (case studies) analysing political economy will explore contextual nuances of mythology through the production values and agendas of media practice. Historical contexts to examples covered in lectures and workshops will advance student knowledge of the diachronic and synchronic dimensions to mythological storytelling.

By adopting approaches from lectures and readings, students will demonstrate their ability to critically analyse mythological storytelling techniques in media texts through workshops, presentations and independent study. The teaching methods that inform these activities will encourage students to adopt multi-modal analytical toolkits for analysing discursive constructions of mythology. These skills will enable students to identify archetypal conventions of fiction and non-fiction texts. Students will develop the reflective skills necessary for understanding mythology in social and historical contexts by appreciating its significance regarding power, society and culture.","The formative research proposal requires students to submit an outline plan for the case study. This should provide evidence of an idea to focus on in the case study and examples of key concepts that will be applied - including relevant literature on those concepts.

5. examine the rise of global and cross-cultural consumer cultures and advertising.
6. investigate and understand the cultural context of specific consumer groups, and develop case studies of specific commodities, practices or cultural contexts.

Cultural consumption is one of the key activities of everyday life. All consumption occurs in relation to advertising, promotion or communication. This module will examine the cultural politics of advertising and consumption in relation to the perspective of cultural studies. It will provide a critical map of the field and bring together work on consumer culture in anthropology and sociology with work on media audiences within media studies and sociology. The rich and idiosyncratic features of local consumption practices will be illustrated through cases from different parts of the world.

Through such cases, the module will show the varying balance between constraint and power and creativity and resistance, making links between consumption and production, and the patterns that shape access to symbolic and material resources. Consumption takes place in the context of everyday lives, in urban, rural and domestic zones: questions of place and identity, poverty, the privatization of the home, and the linking of local everyday practices with broader, global processes are explored. Particular attention is given to the media and new communication technologies as points of overlap and exchange between the local and the global, between domestic consumption and the public sphere.

The module will discuss digital media theories and the impacts of social media interactions on issues of representation, self-perception, and cultural understandings in the society. It provides a set of explicit concepts in relation to the way digital media spaces and user practices operate and the way digital media consumption should be viewed as a new paradigm of communication in contrast to traditional media. The module provides the necessary scholarship for digital media studies with an emphasis on analysing what people say on social media, what they do through and via their digital connections and interactions and how the technology is implicated in the way certain discourses, presentations, understandings and cultural views are consolidated in the contemporary society especially among the youth. It emphasises the social nature of research on digital discourses (i.e. all forms of digital content, e.g. memes, language, videos, comments, smileys, selfies, annotations, and practices, e.g. patterns of Likes, Sharing, networks, etc.) in different social, political and cultural contexts from issues of gender representation, lifestyle and interpersonal relations to digital hate speech and politics of protests and nationalism.

•To further develop their understanding of the conventions of broadcast journalism. 
•To further develop skills in broadcast reporting.
•To further understand the power of pictures and sound in broadcast journalism.
•To undertake training in on-camera broadcast news presentation.
•To further develop an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of journalists working in a  broadcast newsroom.
•To manage their time effectively, working to short and long term deadlines.
•To further evaluate the relevance of the audience in broadcast reporting. 
•To develop an understanding of the ethical and regulatory considerations broadcast journalists face in a modern newsroom.

This module builds upon the understanding of broadcast journalism skills and knowledge introduced in Stage 2 modules in Radio Journalism and Multimedia Journalism to enable students to make their own broadcast quality visual journalism. Students will work within the ethical and regulatory restrictions for broadcast journalists as currently dictated by OFCOM and demonstrate their ability to apply those ideas to practice. They will be encouraged to make newsworthy content with a specific audience in mind.

Students have already begun to consider the importance of the audience, strong images, news values, broadcast writing and interviewing and these concepts will further underpin the practical work they produce in this module. They will continue to engage with social media platforms as a source of newsgathering and distribution and will further develop their understanding and practical application of online newswriting conventions.

Students will benefit from working with experienced TV journalists, and with those creating video journalism for online, and so begin to understand the differences and similarities between those two concepts.

Students will be given feedback on their work through copy clinics, and through shared discussion of their produced content, which is crucial in terms of the journalistic integrity and the pedagogy of the process. The immediacy of the formative feedback enables students to develop confidence in their ability and finesse their writing and shooting technique.",,,,,,"Students will experience how it feels to work in a real life broadcast newsroom, with all the pressures and responsibilities which that entails.

Learning activities take a range of forms on this module, each intended to enhance the learning experience, and to help students achieve key learning outcomes in a structured and iterative accumulation of skills and knowledge.

Workshops will help students to develop their critical thinking alongside others in their peer-group, allowing for a more collaborative approach to learning.  This pedagogic model also involves a reactive approach to understanding and engagement across the cohort, meaning that the pace of delivery may more easily reflect students' technical abilities and rate of learning.

Small group teaching will engender peer-group learning at a more granular level still.

Skills practice will be a significant feature of this course, and best practice in broadcast journalism (for TV news) will be encouraged both in class time and in independent study.  

Reflective learning is a lesser, but nevertheless crucial component of this module; it is essential that students learn to critique 'best practice' in broadcast journalism (for TV news).

Independent study will allow students the opportunity to develop their own understanding or practice, through the body of literature on 'best practice' across a number of aspects of broadcast journalism.","Students will undertake a combination of formative and summative assessments throughout the semester that are designed to build confidence and capability. The techniques will be new to almost all of them and are quite different from conventional news writing and essay style so the enhancement of learning through formative feedback in copy clinics is crucial. 

Formative assessments will be staggered throughout the semester. 

Students are required to work in small groups researching, scripting, shooting, interviewing, presenting and editing an extended TV news item/feature. The item will be a minimum of four minutes in duration - up to a maximum duration of 5 minutes.

The groups are required to write a cue that can be read by a presenter, and which will link the extended news items together, as if for broadcast.

Each group’s concept and research will be presented through a group pitch, which will also include detail on the social media, online and audio elements that would form part of the group portfolio. Students will receive feedback on this pitch and an agreed body of work will be defined. 

Examples will include for the film to be submitted alongside a written version of the story that would go onto the programme’s page on the website but might also be a standalone story to go onto the news pages of that website- this will vary depending on the nature of the ideas that are pitched and is reflective of industry practice. 

The online content should take advantage of the conventions of online copy writing and will usually include a video that demonstrates an understanding of the different conventions of online video in comparison to TV. The portfolio may also include a series of Tweets and/ or series of blog posts with pictures.

The essay will see students reflecting on their own learning journey on the module, but also critically evaluating what they have learned through their experience and how both that experience, and their knowledge of academic media theory, will inform their practise in the future.

•        to encounter new working processes in the realisation of musically creative works, broadening the range of techniques and approaches to contemporary creativity
•        to develop imagination and confidence in creative risk-taking
•        to be able to constructively and critically evaluate one’s own work and that of others
•        to acquire a broader knowledge of the different types of contemporary music practice through focussed listening to selected repertoire as well as exploration of the creative pitential of various different music-making approaches. 

This module introduces students to a range of contemporary approaches to composing contemporary ""classical"", or Western Art Music, primarily for voices and instruments, through a series of projects that will include notated contemporary compositional techniques, enriched at times by improvisation and other music-making techniques. Material covered may include modal, post-tonal, graphic scores, atonality, and approaches using improvisation. Each of the four main projects will include directed listening assignments. It is a practical and experience-based course, delivered through online work packages, ""live"" lectures/workshops, seminar feedback discussions of student work, and directed listening assignments to a wide range of different musics, with examples drawn from medieval to the avant-garde, jazz to electroacoustic, and including the wide range of different kinds of contemporary ""classical"" composition. 

The assignments are set each week which build cumulatively into portfolios of creative work. Students work with the project leaders almost every week, receiving support and feedback on their work and accumulating marks as the module progresses. Students may be required to work independently or in groups depending upon the nature of each specific projects. Students will also be guided through ways in which to engage in self-reflection and critical debate through peer-review. A good working knowledge of music notation is required, but the module includes tutorials and assignments in how to use Sibelius software. As the nature of the material is mostly modal and post-tonal musics, no actual music ""theory"", in the sense of 18th-century harmony, is required, though knowledge of the terminology of this tradition could also be an advantage.",,,,,,"Rationale and relationship to learning outcomes:
•       lectures and practicals (online work packages) introduce and critically discuss creative techniques, demonstrating how they can be used, and illustrating this through reference to selected examples from the contemporary repertoire. Guidelines and examples of practical projects to be carried out by students are included. Some lectures will also involve a degree of practical participation that may then break out into the scheduled small-group sessions (see below).
•       small group teaching takes the form of supervised seminars and workshops, supporting and critically evaluating the progress of each group of students through looking at previous week's assignments, as well as suggesting possible strategies with which to approach the creative challenges set. These sessions may also include more direct practical exercises such as group improvisation in further enrichment of the creative sills development.
•       skills practice has students working through their own responses to the weekly assignments, or the more involved final creative projects associated with each of the four projects throughout the year.
•       structured research and reading activities will mostly involve listening assignments, with set pieces of repertoire, evaluating and critically reflecting on them, and finding ways to adapt what has been learned in creative ways within the students's own work. Listening assignments lead to greater awareness of the diversity of creative opportunities in the present day, develop critical skills in evaluating the work of others, and by reflection on the student's own creative work, as well as developing listening skills more generally.","•       this is an experiential and practice-based course, and the success, or otherwise, of the students’ work is measured by the success with which they produce an engaged and creative response to the challenges set.

Although there will be guided projects in which we experiment with music-making in different places and spaces, students will also be encouraged to investigate ways that space and place affect and inform non-experimental musics, too - the role of the architecture of St. Mark's in Venice on early Baroque music, for example, or music composed or devised to be played outdoors in the woods. One strand of the module addresses “environmental” issues in the broader sense, while the other examines, through theory and practice, ways in which music (and sound art) may be ""site-specific""; in other words, how some musics are made for certain spaces, whereas other do not really ""fit"". Readings are introduced and discussed which outline key issues, including the relationship of humans to their environment, the Nature-Culture divide in its historical and philosophical context, specific historical ways in which musicians (and contemporary) sound artists have engaged with environment, and a critique of such projects in the light of contemporary environmental knowledge. 

By the end of the module, students should have begun to develop their own environmental sound practice, which may take the form of live performance (note, the module is suitable for students whose primary interest is not necessarily “contemporary” music or sound art, and that projects which engage with “early” or “folk” musics would also be considered), installation, fixed-media work, or sonic sculpture.

7.        To cultivate technical, cultural and historical knowledge relevant to this practice.



This module gives you an opportunity to learn about Indian music by doing it. Apart from giving you a practical introduction to Indian music, it will also help you develop a range of general musical skills valuable to your existing musical practice(s) – e.g. improved listening, rhythmic and ensemble sense, intonation, ability to improvise. It will also enrich your knowledge of musical culture, theory and history.

You don’t have to have any prior experience of Indian music to take this module – just a suitable level of musicianship in any musical practice (classical, popular, folk etc.). You’ll have the option (subject to available places) of studying on vocal, tabla, or possibly a western instrument. As a student on the module you’ll help build a community of practitioners; and, related to this, you’ll get to organise and participate in group riy?z (practise) sessions, baithaks (informal gatherings to share music), and workshops, and attend relevant performances in the University, the region or online.

Because this will be a mostly new practice to you, assessment will NOT be completely staked on a summative final recital. Instead, it will be based on a mixture of elements: tutors’ evaluation of your progress on the course and the quality of your practising (riy?z); your general engagement with the subject, based on a portfolio of short assignments; and a short, informal practical presentation.",,,,,,"Small group teaching (vocal / tabla lessons) provide the core of students’ learning.

Student independent learning for this course, which involves listening, reading and reflecting on key sources and texts, helps to develop and enrich knowledge of the musical traditions and scholarly historiography of the folk music of Britain, Ireland and their diasporas, and how these relate to the sociological and musicological understanding of traditional and folk music.","The investigative portfolio requires students to use ideas, understanding, knowledge and techniques gained through study of the module’s key themes to a particular set of short prescribed assignments, developing their independent research skills. This gives students the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding and knowledge of musical traditions, idioms and techniques through direct reference to recorded examples, archives and reading. The portfolio is marked in the semester 2 assessment period. The first two tasks are 500 word exercises. The third task is an MP3 file of a creative arrangement plus 500 word commentary or alternatively a 1000 word essay. The final component is an essay of 2000 words which tests students' knowledge of a particular aspect of folk and traditional music historiography.

The formative component, comprising a series of short, in-class presentations, allows students to share their progress on the portfolio tasks at regular intervals during the semester and receive staff and peer feedback.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/sacs/,

University of Newcastle,NU,Arts and Cultures,Music and Visual Culture,20,Dr Goffredo Plastino,"'Music and Visual Culture' is a theory-oriented module that includes an historical, cultural and critical evaluation of selected visual documents. The module gives a broad overview of music iconography and visual culture studies methodologies in the study of past and present musical images, using an interdisciplinary approach. The images considered in the module are evaluated within their historical and cultural contexts and in relation to the typical examples of visual arts of their times. The module aims to activate and embolden an appreciation of music images and to allow students to make comparisons and experience the connections between different visual forms. The module also encourages students to apply visual culture studies methodologies to their own practice as musicians, listeners to music and/or observers of musical images. No previous musical knowledge is needed.

The module is designed to:
•        offer students an introduction to music iconography and visual culture theories, methodologies and major writings, through the consideration of a corpus of selected images;
•        illustrate how music iconography and visual culture studies consider and analyse past and present music visual representations.",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce issues, approaches and concepts, and give the opportunity to discuss and explore these further.

This module is aimed at students who wish to continue learning Indian music – on vocal or tabla (or possibly instrumental study), having already had at least one year’s experience of learning. The learning approaches follow a similar pattern to MUS2045, and place the experience of the guru-?i?y? parampar? (guru-disciple tradition) at its heart. Additionally, you undertake complementary academic study that informs your practical learning; because this is a final stage module (level 6), it involves an element of research.

As a student on the module you’ll help build a community of practitioners, and, related to this, you’ll get to organise and participate in group riy?z (practise) sessions, baithaks (informal gatherings to share music), and workshops; and attend relevant performances in the University, in the region or online.

Assessment will be based on a two main components: 

(i) A final performance. This will be live if present-in person assessment is possible, or through an equivalent video presentation if not. The mark will also be informed by your tutors’ evaluation of your progress on the course and the quality of your riy?z (practising).

Specifically, key questions taught are: 
1) what is business growth and how do we measure it?
2) what sort of people are associated with business growth and entrepreneurship, and is business growth an over-hyped phenomenon we should be wary of?
3) are entrepreneurs born or made?
4) How do the principles of legitimate/moral and illegitimate/immoral business growth relate to each other?
5) How should managers and marketers respond when their business growth is threatened?
6) How does creative marketing and management practices and principles relate to business growth? 7) How can – and should – we condition and socialize employees to produce business growth?
8) To what extent are we impaired, as managers and marketers, when trying to acquire business growth by definition of working with humans who are flawed?
9) How does one’s gender, class and other aspects of their identity relate to their experiences of business growth; and how can identity be better engaged with by managers and marketers seeking enterprise?

There are 4 1-hour formative sessions specifically about the assessments. The first is about the challenging task of searching for information for their own cases and ultimately deciding what case to undertake in the assignment (company and systems). This is very formative since it is the first time the students have a similar assignment. Another one at the middle of the course about the content of the first part of the assignment, and another almost at the end about the content of the second part of the assignment.

Individually held perceptions and expectations of organization and work, and our own likely (and hoped for) roles in them (and our resistance to them) are greatly influenced by media content such as film and television however they are delivered. The media offers us insights into organisations, but only from particular and often limited perspectives. The importance of the perceptions and expectations subsequently encouraged, lies in the fact that, once established, they are then able to influence how organisations (and ultimately society) are themselves patterned. Our expectations of the organisations we become a part of will ultimately help to shape them. 

This module seeks to raise awareness among students of management/organization of how certain theorists have emphasized the influence of media/culture over representations, and therefore understandings of and expectations for, management and organisation.

University of Newcastle,NU,Newcastle University Business School,Mathematics for Economics,20,Dr Robert Anderson,"To develop students ability to apply basic mathematical techniques in economic analysis.

Economics is an essentially quantitative subject.  If we are to have a significant understanding of how individuals, corporations and societies confront the problems posed by the scarcity of resources, then it is essential that we should be in a position to analyse the quantitative relationship between key economic variables.  In turn, this means that in order to be able to conduct this sort of quantitative analysis we must have access to a basic kit of mathematical tools.  This course therefore aims to provide students with such a kit.  In particular, the course covers essential mathematical topics such as sets, functions and equations, as well as differential and integral calculus.  The focus throughout is on the application of mathematical methods in the analysis of economic problems.",,,,,,"Lectures provide a detailed development of key mathematical ideas and techniques along with their application to the analysis of economic problems. Small-group seminars provide an opportunity to discuss and demonstrate the application of these key mathematical tools. The feedback opportunity these seminars provide is vital to ensuring a solid foundation of the key topics on which the module builds as it progresses. Given the nature of economics as a largely quantitative subject, a sound grounding in mathematics provided by both lectures and a number of topic specific small-group sessions is therefore essential to achieve the learning outcomes of the module.","In addition to the examples given in lectures, additional problem solving exercises are available on Canvas, together providing formative assessment and feedback for students to engage with as part of their learning, and in preparation for the seminars.

The continuous summative assessment component not only provides additional practice of important concepts learnt throughout the course, but enables students' to gauge their understanding and encourage self-study of the course material, as the difficultly level builds through the course.

The semester one online PC examination is used as a temperature check, and also a consolidation point, for students understanding, prior to the more advanced material developed in semester two.

The final written exam tests the overall knowledge learnt and allows students to demonstrates their ability in applying the mathematics skills learnt to a range of economic problems. This is undertaken in a timed invigilated examination environment, as this is best suited to assessing the learning objectives so ensuring the required standard of mathematics is achieved to enable completion of later stages of an economics related degree programme.

The concepts of short run, medium run and long run are central to this process; as is the distinction between open and closed economy modelling. There is also an emphasis on helping students understand contemporary policy-making issues. For example, students have the opportunity to develop knowledge and understanding of a (medium run) macroeconomic framework typical of that used in central banks to support contemporary monetary policy design.

The module deals with questions around causal inference. OLS always identifies some form of partial correlation. However, if people can self-select or if not all relevant variables are observable, these partial correlations might not have a causal interpretation. To frame our thinking, we will consider two useful frameworks to think about causality - the first is a definition of causality based on the potential outcomes framework (also called the Rubin causal model) that enables us to define the effect of a treatment on an outcome as the difference between an observed outcome and a hypothetical “counterfactual” outcome that would have prevailed had a different treatment state been realised. We will also consider a more recent approach based on graphical methods pioneered by Judea Pearl.

This involves a brief examination of what is meant by social welfare, and how economists typically evaluate social arrangements.  The notion of market failure is then examined with particular emphasis being placed on public goods.  Various allocation mechanisms are considered which illustrate problems with government provision.  The working of the political system itself is an important theme, with some time spent looking at voting and lobbying.    

The second semester of the course examines the economics of local public goods, which are public goods whose benefit is spatially defined. It leads to a discussion of local government, fiscal federalism and the opportunities for political participation. The second part of the module looks at how individuals interact to determine the appropriate level of public goods. This is social decision-making and it discusses how decisions are made in practice through intermediaries in the form of parties, leading to theories of the political business cycle. The remaining part looks at tax theory - known as optimal taxation - and the practice of taxation, focusing on the UK experience.  Much of this is concerned with the efficiency aspects of taxation, known as the excess burden.",,,,,,"Lectures provide an exhaustive and in-depth treatment of the core course material.

University of Newcastle,NU,Newcastle University Business School,Research Methods for Business and Marketing,20,Dr Eftychia Palamida,"The aim of the module is to provide students with the knowledge, skills and confidence to be able to investigate and report on key “business and marketing” related issues. The research process will be explained in detail by focusing both on a qualitative and quantitative perspective. This is based on the notion that qualitative and quantitative research are mutually important and necessary in order to understand and apply any research method in a given research project.  

The module will involve a structured approach to the research/business problem by indicating how the potential theoretical and/or practical research gaps can be identified and reported by selecting the appropriate supporting literature (theory) via the use of online databases and diverse types of journal articles. Students will be re-introduced to the Harvard Newcastle referencing style to effectively reference the required source material. The module will outline the basic steps in the formulation of the research topic, aim, questions and objectives, the way in which these should be used to determine the appropriate research strategy, and how these three interrelate to suggest applicable research techniques. Particularly, students will be introduced to the concept of research by being exposed to the research philosophy (positivist and interpretivist paradigms and more recent developments in pragmatic perspectives), research approach (deductive and inductive) and research methods (quantitative and qualitative). Emphasis will be placed on sampling techniques (including reporting of sample size and characteristics), data collection and data analysis using specific software tools. The module will also emphasise on the creation of the conceptual model for both quantitative and qualitative methods-based studies. It will explain the process in hypotheses formulation and their link to the conceptual model and research questions/objectives for the quantitative methods-based studies. Students will also be made aware of the ethical considerations concerning research. The presentation, interpretation and discussion of the findings in an appropriate and professional manner both for academic and business purposes will be discussed in detail. This will be supported by a holistic perspective of what research limitations stand for and how these are related to future research propositions. 

The above will lead to the creation of an effective and efficient Qualitative/Quantitative Research Proposal that will provide the starting point and the theoretical grounding for the Final Year Comprehensive Research Project that students are expected to undertake in a “business and marketing” related topic.",,,,,,"The teaching methods that are employed in the Module are Lectures, Small Group Teaching and Workshops.

Lectures will introduce students to the concepts of research methods while Small Group Teaching such as Seminars (Research Gap-Aim-RQ/RO-Conceptual Model and Hypotheses) and Workshops such as Labs (Nvivo and SPSS software) will actively involve them in the process of applying theory into practice. Essentially students will learn by experience as a significant proportion of the teaching will be student-centred and involve in-class work. Students will be encouraged to develop their competencies by participating in in-class theoretical/practical activities and case discussions on choosing, justifying and planning for a “business and marketing” related research project. 

Directed and Independent learning along with a Research-rich leaning approach is utilised to meet the module Knowledge and skills outcomes. 

Directed Learning will engage students in further research to support and enhance learning in the Lectures and Small Group Teaching such as Seminars and Workshops such as Labs by utilising a range of tasks such as including pre-reading, preparation for interactive activities and use of e-learning platforms etc. Students will also be given the opportunity to demonstrate high level knowledge based on directed learning in their assessment. 

Independent Learning is central to this module as students will be asked to identify and pursue areas of interest and gain deeper or broader knowledge of the subject area, through a range of learning activities that might include, reading, reflection, research etc. Students will also be encouraged to engage in wider reading beyond the learning materials provided, particularly in relation to the potential “business and marketing” related topics. 

A Research-rich Learning approach underpins the learning and teaching philosophy of this module. “Business and Marketing” related research is embedded in lectures as part of directed and independent learning where students actively discuss and engage with research outcomes. Most importantly, students learn about research, learn how to research as the main part of their lectures of this module and are expected to actively plan for and engage in their own proposed research in the form of an individual Research Poster and Proposal.","Formative Assessment
Formative Assessment is provided through formative oral feedback from peers and/or tutors within scheduled Small Group Teaching such as Seminars and Workshops such as Labs, addressing the chosen topic and proposed approach. This will be based on diverse practices such as ongoing monitoring of student progress through interaction, overall student performance, discussion and feedback of the coursework in class. The nature of the techniques used will be at the discretion of the module leader in collaboration with the tutors.

Marketing strategy is a process that helps enterprises and organisations to analyse their business environment and identify business opportunities to achieve their goals (profitable/non-profitable).

The first semester focuses on the strategic analysis of the market drivers such as consumers, competitors, the industry and the macro environment of political, economic, technological, ecologic and legal disruptions. Being capable of analysing and monitoring such trends places enterprises and organisations in a better position to evaluate and select long-and short-term implementation of marketing efforts. 

The second semester focuses on the planning and implementation of strategic moves. Based on the insights gained from semester 1, semester 2 introduces comprehensive planning frameworks and techniques drawing from traditional (red ocean) and contemporary (blue ocean) understandings of strategy, which will booster students' understanding and skillset of designing effective integrated marketing programs, and managing customer relationships for the long term. 

Using contemporary and cutting edge concepts and cases, the module also emphasises the need for integrity in the strategic planning process, as well as the design of marketing programs that are both ethical and socially responsible. An emphasis on critical thinking enables students to understand the essence of how marketing decisions fit together to create a coherent strategy. Throughout the module, examples of successful and unsuccessful planning and implementation are used to illustrate how firms face and fail the challenges of marketing strategy in today’s economy. In particular, this module will be delivered through introducing relevant literature, learning experiences, and industry-linked case studies to guarantee transfer knowledge from theory to practice.",,,,,,"This module has received a complete overhaul in terms of content, structure and assessment requirements.

Formative assessment
The module has been designed so that students will work on some of the elements required for their summative assessment during the teaching sessions throughout the semester.  Students will be invited to discuss their progress in class as a case study.  This has a number of benefits:
• Student are producing work that can be used for their summative assessment
• Students can debate and share good practice 
• Students will receive feedforward on these discussions.

Summative Assessment
The final report is designed to allow students to provide a reasoned case for data analytics and a critical appraisal of the managerial implications for implementing a chosen solution.

The individual component must be submitted in the assessment period following the taught elements.  Each student will be required to produce a 2000 word report.  The report must be supported by theory and reflective comment.

Feedback Strategy
Formative: as stated earlier, there will be a number of opportunities where formative feedback will be provided throughout the module, particularly in relation to practical tasks.  

Summative: For each component of assessment there is a respective standard marking criteria that will indicate how marks are allocated to the work, alongside the annotated comments on the work and overall summary comments provided using electronic marking.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/business/nubs-pg/,

University of Newcastle,NU,NUBS Postgraduate,"Strategy, Management and Information Systems",20,Dr Arturo Vega,"The module aims to provide students with an understanding of information systems and its relevance for modern-day economies and societies. More specifically, it explains how a comprehensive view of traditional information systems (IS) and the opportunities given by contemporary Internet-based innovations is central for understanding the anatomy of e-business and how it has, and will continue enabling radical changes in the economic contexts, business models, corporate strategies, organisational designs and ultimately in the management of innovations in firms and entire industrial sectors.    
We divided the module into two parts. The first part equips students to understand the fundamental principles of IS as well as relevant business applications, and from there to apply them in innovative ways in order to create sustainable competitive advantages and beat competitors. The second part of the module is about major topics which certainly could enable or block the materialisation of the e-strategies, and managers have to be knowledgeable of them in order to take decisions and appropriate courses of action, for example technology, the IS life cycle, organisational aspects, the implementation process and international systems.",,,,,,"The teaching methods will be based on a mix of lectures, the demonstration of business applications, videos, mini case studies, group work and open discussions and debates in the seminars. A substantial input is expected in the form of guided background reading, private study as well as in the preparation for the assessments. The background reading, private study and lectures will be the methods to introduce theoretical concepts, which will be complemented with employability aspects in a number of specific sessions. The demonstration of the business applications and videos will be used to get a more practical understanding of business processes, strategies and real information systems. The case studies are more focused to the discussion of soft aspects which affect information systems such as organisational, implementation and social issues. A substantial component of the module is based on the search for and analysis of real company, market, product and supplier information, as well as of the impact of information systems in society and e-business related career paths.","The assignment is integrative and addresses the whole module. It is about business applications, strategy, the alignment of IS and strategic objectives, and a plethora of critical success factors that are related to all the topics learnt during the module, e.g. technology, organisations, the IS life cycle, development approaches, projects and so on. It requires the research of substantial empirical material related to real firms, information systems initiatives, the external and internal environments of companies and the diverse aspects that influenced the outcome of the systems in a business perspective. The assignment is challenging in the sense that, to begin, the students have to search for empirical information to decide about the company and information system initiative that they will write their case. Then, the students have to build the case study, based on both theory and IS-related concepts as well as case-specific information. The case study is descriptive, explanative and critical, and very close to what the students would do in their future job as consultants, in terms of both knowledge and skills.

Formative assessment

In the seminars, the students undertake class exercises based on a set of questions and mini case studies, videos or software demonstrations. There are discussions between peers in groups and then the whole class, all facilitated by the teacher. The discussions are related to specific topics of the syllabus but with a deliberate formative focus on driving and facilitating the study for the summative assessments. 
There are 4 1-hour formative sessions specifically about the assessments. The first is early almost at the beginning of the module, about the challenging task of searching for information for their own cases and ultimately deciding what case to undertake in the assignment (company and systems). This is very formative since it’s the first time the students have a similar assignment. Another one is in the middle of the module about the content of the first part of the assignment, and another one almost at the end about the content of the second part of the assignment. These sessions are largely structured on the most important feedback that the module leader has compiled from years delivering the course and marking, as well as personal questions of the students who have already started the study, data collection and development of the assignments.

The module has been designed so that students will work on some of the elements required for their summative assessment during the teaching sessions throughout the semester. Students will be invited to discuss their progress in class as a case study. This has a number of benefits:

• Student are producing work that can be used for their summative assessment
• Students can debate and share good practice
• Students will receive feedforward on these discussions.

Summative Assessment
The final report is designed to allow students to provide a reasoned case for data analytics and a critical appraisal of the managerial implications for implementing a chosen solution. The individual component must be submitted in the assessment period following the taught elements. Each student will be required to produce a 2000 word report. The report must be supported by data analysis and reflective comment.

Feedback Strategy
Formative: as stated earlier, there will be a number of opportunities where formative feedback will be provided throughout the module, particularly in relation to practical tasks.

Summative: For each component of assessment there is a respective standard marking criteria that will indicate how marks are allocated to the work, alongside the annotated comments on the work and overall summary comments",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/business/nubs-pg/,

The teaching and learning methods support achievement of the module’s learning outcomes. The processes of teaching and learning, within this blended learning module, include but are not limited to the following: Face-to-face and online opportunities to acquire knowledge and understanding of theory in practice are provided through attending lectures, listening to and watching podcasts and/or videos, reading and research, and work-based and reflective learning. Learning through dialogue, discussion and collaboration, in face-to-face teaching and online, enables students to articulate, respond to and provide feedback on theory, knowledge and practice application, and to question and challenge their work-based practices. Collaborative social learning, online and in the classroom, is a hallmark of the module and will involve peer learning, co-production of knowledge and ideas about practice, and feedback. 

As a post-experience programme, contextualising theory in practice requires not only academic input but also practitioners’ knowledge and expertise and, therefore, some lectures or workshops will be taught by adjunct staff. Reflection on practice, through completion of a reflective journal, supports the learner to evaluate their understanding of the relevant subject knowledge, and to question and challenge their work-based practices, through applying and integrating theory in practice. 

Students are expected to enhance their face-to-face and online learning by independent reading and enquiry, for which they are given guidance on relevant materials.","Formative Feedback

Formative feedback is provided throughout the module by encouraging learners to respond to questions and engage in reflection, dialogue, debate and discussion in online and face-to-face contexts. Collaborative learning, online and in the classroom, is a hallmark of the module and involves co-production of knowledge and ideas about practice, and feedback. 

Summative Feedback

The module assessment enables learners to achieve the learning outcomes and to consolidate their learning by articulating their conceptual understanding and how it is used in practice. 

The assessment comprises a reflective log that demonstrates making sense of working in groups in relation to own identity, practice and development as a coach and identification of future skills that they may need.

A reflective learning Portfolio is central to completion of the summative assessment, enabling them to consolidate what they have learned by reflecting on and articulating their personal and/or organisation practice and how it relates to their current conceptual understanding.

 - Material culture (e.g. props, special effects, costumes, cosmetics); 
 - Dramatic representation of identity (e.g. race, sexuality, gender, class);  
 - Politics and religion (e.g. containment v. subversion) 

This module takes a creative, imaginative, and practical approach to pre-1642 drama. Our focus on ‘stagecraft’ means that we will be investigating scenes from late medieval and Renaissance plays to see how they actually worked under the conditions for which they were written and how they might be performed today. We will explore how you can conjure up a devil onstage, what makes effective stage blood, and consider what it was like to see female audience members hijack a performance. Early drama was also a subversive medium of entertainment, and so we will be exploring the wider social and political ramifications of these plays: if an actor can perform royalty simply by putting on a crown, then what really is the difference between a stage-king and a real one? How can you get away with speaking blasphemy and profanity onstage?",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce the students to key literary texts, key concepts, and critical paradigms.

Decolonisation refers in this context, not just to political formations (e.g. nationalism, anti-colonial resistance, independence movements) but also cultural formations, including those relating to language, psychology and literature. Decolonisation involves the conception of an alternative reality, and is therefore critically concerned with the work of the imagination.

By exploring the literature and thought of key African, Caribbean, Indian and black British writers from the twentieth century to the present, this module will introduce you to a range of texts that examine, narrate, and critique the cultural construction of decolonisation.

However, the global citizen has its roots in early understandings of cosmopolitanism, and has often been deployed as a means of securing and maintaining a colonial relationship in Western society and expanding the empire. This module will therefore consider the emergence and development of the child as global citizen within literary, historical, educational, and other materials targeted for children. You will also be introduced to a number of important works of theoretical and literary criticism as a way of deepening your understanding of the primary resources discussed in the module. 

The module will offer an introduction to American children’s literature, with some attention to international texts that are rarely taught in the literary canon.

Assessment preparation time reflects the need for both steady reflective engagement with learning and the undertaking of independent research and thinking.
As for all English Literature modules, extensive independent research and reading under the guidance of the module leader is an essential element of the development of students' knowledge and skills.","Together, the two assessment forms provide an appropriate way of testing the student’s grasp in breadth and depth of the texts and concepts covered by the module, in a format that also evaluates the skills developed. 

The reflective log will embed and sustain students' ongoing engagement with the module, including their preparation for and participation in classes and study groups, and their independent study.

The essay will require students to engage in detail with the texts and concepts studied, demonstrating their ability to relate critical and historical debates to textual analysis, as well as assessing key discipline-specific skills in research and writing. 

The chosen forms of assessment correspond to the Department’s commitment to providing an appropriate range of methods and moments of assessment across all modules.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/elll/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"English Literature, Language and Linguistics",Old English: Texts and Translations (Inactive),20,Dr Adam Mearns,"This module gives you the chance to develop skills in reading and translating Old English (OE), based on the foundation of an understanding of its grammar and vocabulary. Lecture materials introduce the main linguistic features of OE, while small group sessions and discussions focus on issues involved in the translation of texts, using knowledge of the linguistic features. We also make use of some online materials, including hypertext editions of OE texts, dictionaries, and the Thesaurus of Old English. The reading covers an interesting range of texts, providing insights into aspects of Anglo-Saxon life and culture, as well as the Old English language. Most of the texts are prose, but there are also extracts from the poetry, including Beowulf, where we compare the original text with a variety of different published translations.",,,,,,"Lecture materials introduce key concepts, themes, issues and resources related to: (a) the historical background of Old English (OE); (b) features of OE grammar; (c) the analysis and interpretation of OE lexis; and (d) approaches to translation, in relation to OE specifically, as well as in general.

The small group sessions will focus on discussion of: (a) issues and questions arising from lecture materials; (b) the translation and grammatical analysis of extracts from set texts; and (c) other issues related to the knowledge and skills that will be assessed in the module assignments.

In combination, the lecture materials and small group discussions will therefore focus at different points in the semester on the module’s four main topics, which link to the intended learning outcomes and are represented across the two assignments: (1) OE grammar; (2) OE lexis; (3) approaches to translation; and, informed by these three, (4) the critical evaluation of the process and practice of translating OE, in terms of both reflecting on our own translations and analysing previously published translations by others.

The guided independent study will involve: (a) following up on reading and other resources identified in the lecture materials; (b) translating extracts from the set texts (using online materials); and (c) other general reading and revision that will aid in preparation for the mid-module and end-of-semester assignments.","Written Exercise 1 (mid-module, 20%) involves the translation and grammatical analysis of a short passage of Old English (OE). The analysis requires identification of morphological features and syntactic structures, together with brief comments on selected phonological features. This promotes and assesses learning of essential aspects of Old English grammar. In doing so, it also serves as useful preparation for the end-of-semester assignment.

Written Exercise 2 (end-of-semester, 80%, 3200 words in total) consists of:
(1) A reflective commentary on one of the set-text translations produced during the semester (c.1000 words). The commentary will discuss in detail the approach that has been taken in dealing with some of the specific linguistic features of the original text, both grammatical and lexical. This consolidates and assesses knowledge and understanding of the linguistic features of OE and of the issues involved in translating those features into Present-Day English.
(2) An analysis (c.2200 words) that focuses on EITHER: (a) a detailed comparison of two different published translations of a passage from an OE poem, exploring the different approaches and choices made by the translators in relation to the linguistic features of the original text; OR (b) a lexical study of a semantic field that examines the range of related words/concepts available to OE writers, exploring issues such as how the words have been defined in dictionaries of OE and how they have been handled by translators of OE poetry. In either case, the task calls for a careful understanding of the OE texts and their translations, taking into account issues of literary style and the impact of different approaches to translation, as well as requiring a strong grasp of linguistic detail.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/elll/,

Students will develop knowledge of a range of canonical and non-canonical texts, including English translations of important French texts from the period. We will focus particularly on the transnational rise of the literature and culture of Sensibility, examining how sentimental discourses were invoked to depict women both as arbiters of moral virtue and creatures of excessive sensuality.

Students will gain a thorough knowledge of the historical and cultural contexts in which literary texts were written, combining this knowledge with some gender and feminist theory to examine cultural shifts in attitudes to female desire and definitions of female virtue. We will connect these historical and cultural changes with formal and generic developments in the literature of the period, particularly the rise of the novel. The module enable students to analyse early feminist efforts to politicise the discourse of Sensibility and to comment on the construction of feminine identities at the intersection of discourses of gender, race, and class.",,,,,,"The lecture materials introduce students to knowledge outcomes relevant to the module.

University of Newcastle,NU,"English Literature, Language and Linguistics",Enlightened Romantics: writing on the margins,20,Dr Jennifer Orr,"What does it mean to be human? How can we shape our own destiny?  And are some destinies considered to be more important than others? These philosophical questions, central to Enlightenment and Romantic thought, were discussed widely in the Eighteenth Century from the University to the village hall. Today, the discipline of the Humanities demands that we consider these questions from the perspective of different voices, asking critically why some voices have been, and continue to be, heard above others. 

The Eighteenth Century was a period of revolutionary change, inspired by the philosophical ideas of Enlightenment. It was also the creation of the United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland out of the emerging British Empire, the consequences of which we are still living with today. It was one of the most exciting periods in the expansion of literacy and print culture; newspapers, lending libraries and sociable gatherings extended opportunities for people across society to read, debate ideas and to demand change. City merchants in coffeehouses, artisan weavers gathered in cottage bookclubs and working people gathered in the local pub not only engaged with these conversations but could themselves become fitting subjects as writers sought to capture real life and local character.  

Yet until recently, the version of Romanticism taught in schools was mostly confined to poetry written by middle class, white, English men. While we don't exclude these writers, we want to look at British Romanticism as a 'four nations' movement where the idea of being a corner of an emerging Empire with a global reach was looked at critically. Some embraced it, some resisted it and others engaged with it whilst seeking to preserve and animate their own local cultures on the page. 

A growing literary marketplace which included larger numbers of middle- and working class readers, as well as the wealthy, desired to hear an 'authentic' voice emerge from the page, one that engaged with the deepest human questions and echoed their own human desires and aspirations. The labouring-class poet took the marketplace by storm, particularly in the glamorous ploughman-poet figure of Robert Burns whose 'heaven-taught' poetic skill seemed to offer the British public a taste of the deepest feelings of the human heart in the real language of men. But there is more to the labouring poet than meets the eye. Engaged with the philosophy and politics of their day, they took ideas to the widest possible audience, subverting audience expectations to set their own literary agenda and paving the way for the marginalised voices for centuries to come.",,,,,,"The lectures introduce students to knowledge outcomes relevant to the module. They address themes common to the authors studied and encourage the students to think comparatively. They also provide short examples of close reading technique to be practised further in seminar.  

The seminars allow for the development of knowledge outcomes through close reading of specified texts, and the practice of skills, especially oral presentation and interpersonal communication.","Assessment by written exercise at the end of the semester is appropriate for a Stage 3 module.

It begins with the poetic revolution initiated by Ezra Pound in the 1910s and concludes with the late modernism of the Beat Generation and the British Poetry Revival.

After looking at Imagism's break with poetic tradition, we will examine various currents in modernist verse: its origins in the late-Romantic avant-garde of the nineteenth century, its ambivalent relationship with English, American and regional identities, its use of music as inspiration and ideal, the often neglected centrality of women poets and the much-contested political backdrop. In the final weeks students will look closely at how these subjects found expression in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from the 1960s onwards, in the writing and activities of local poet Basil Bunting and his circle (a field trip/walking tour of Newcastle will supplement this part of the module).

Two-hour seminars will allow students to make connections between texts and writers and to ensure that the imagining of liberty is addressed through deep and extensive discussion as appropriate for a Stage 3 module. One seminar will take the form of a workshop in Newcastle University Library's Special Collections to examine its early editions of Godwin, Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley and manuscripts by Byron, Coleridge and Mary Shelley.

Students will be invited to meet the module leader in his consultation and feedback hours to ask any questions about the module to discuss preparation for their formative essay, feedback on their formative essay and to have their final essay title approved (if they wish to choose their own title) and/or to address queries about their final essays.

Study groups are a useful way of ensuring that students are adequately prepared for seminars and also building their participation and engagement skills.","Students will research and write a 2,750-word final essay (85% of the assessment). The essay will be required to make detailed reference to two texts (at least one of which must be a text studied in the module) by a writer or writer or writers studied in the module. Students will be given the option to choose their own essay title (to be approved by the Module Leader), if they wish. Allowing students scope for their own initiative is appropriate for assessment at Stage 3.

The mid-semester formative assignment will be a formative essay of 1000 words. It is essential for students to consolidate their learning in the first six weeks through a piece of written work on which they get feedback before submitting their final essay.

A component of the overall mark will be for seminar participation and engagement (15% of the assessment). Part of this mark will be based on a short reflective piece of 250 words on the student's participation and engagement with the module.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/elll/,

It teaches students the key methodological challenges and theoretical imperatives for studying the language use of older adults, and explores with them how insights from gerontology, geriatrics and cognitive psychology can enrich our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning language variation and change in older adults. Students will learn to apply the following to the analysis and interpretation of vernacular speech data from older adults: advanced methodological tools from variationist sociolinguistics; ongoing discoveries about language and ageing from across the language sciences; and multi-disciplinary insights into the complexity of age and ageing from the health and social sciences. Students will also participate in reciprocal intergenerational learning activities with older community members, which will enhance their intergenerational communication skills and support their development as socially responsive and responsible citizens in age-friendly communities. These activities will also ensure that students’ findings from their project work reach a wider audience of non-linguists.",,,,,,"LECTURES are used, primarily, to impart information and provide an overall coherence for the module.

SMALL-GROUP TEACHING SESSIONS are used to consolidate students’ understanding of the lecture and reading materials, to plan plan and prepare (group) assignments, and to develop students’ transferable skills in linguistic data analysis. 

GUIDED INDEPENDENT STUDY is used for the preparation of seminar and workshop exercises as well as for the preparation and completion of assignments.","The WRITTEN EXERCISE provides an opportunity for formative feedback. Students will prepare an outline or abstract for their research paper. 

The RESEARCH PAPER tests students’ analytical, numerical, IT and writing skills. Students use the acquired numerical skills to quantify patterns of linguistic variation in their data; they use the acquired software skills to visualize these patterns; and they write up the results for a specialist target audience. Crucially, the essay challenges students to think across disciplinary boundaries and use the knowledge from guest lectures to interpret the results of their analyses. 

The REPORT tests students’ ability to communicate the results of their data analyses to a lay audience of older adults. It is produced by groups of students under the guidance of older community members whose role it is to advise on focus and pitch, and to flag instances of inaccessible or ageist language use. The collaboration between students and older adults also develops students’ intergenerational communication skills and fosters intergenerational learning.

 - Performance (audiences, actors, staging, metadrama)
 - Material culture (props, special effects, costumes, cosmetics)
 - Dramatic representation (race, sexuality, gender, class)
 - Politics and religion (containment v. subversion) 

This module takes a creative, imaginative, and practical approach to pre-1700 drama. Our focus on ‘stagecraft’ means that we will be workshopping scenes from late medieval and Renaissance plays to see how they actually worked under the conditions for which they were written. We will explore how you can conjure up a devil onstage, what makes effective stage blood, and consider what it was like to see female audience members hijack a performance. Early drama was also a subversive medium of entertainment, and so we will be exploring the wider social and political ramifications of these plays: if an actor can perform royalty simply by putting on a crown, then what really is the difference between a stage-king and a real one? How can you get away with speaking blasphemy and profanity onstage? We will also be engaging with topics that are controversial today, such as how and whether plays that originally included antisemitic characters or the use of blackface can be studied and performed today. Is it ever possible to truly modernise old plays for performance? How can we draw out the contemporary relevance of centuries-old drama?",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce the students to key literary texts, key concepts, and critical paradigms. As all the texts are dramatic, seminars will investigate the texts of these plays, and ‘theatre labs’ will enable students to gain confidence in testing out their readings through experimenting with rehearsal techniques. Both develop their communication and analytical skills. Study groups will help to develop students' teamwork, leadership and problem solving skills by taking it in turns to lead their group’s exploration of a scene or excerpt ahead of the seminar. A set of supervisory meetings spread across the second half of the module, will be used to ensure that students are in a good position to prepare the necessary components of the portfolio, a completed version being due in the final week.","Students will be assessed by the submission of a portfolio at the end of the module. A formative project or essay plan is due earlier in the semester. 

Students will be regularly contributing to course blogs during the module, from which they can select examples of their best material to include in the portfolio (c.1250 words).

Students will develop knowledge of a range of canonical and non-canonical texts, including examples of literature written by authors whose engagement with the supernatural is less well-known. We will focus particularly on the process through which Burke and Radcliffe's theory of ‘terror’ illuminates contemporary anxieties surrounding gender, class, race and nationhood, and examine how these fears were transformed throughout the eighteenth-century, Romantic and Victorian eras. 

Students will gain a thorough knowledge of the historical and cultural contexts which inspired the rise of the supernatural in fiction. They will also combine this knowledge with some contemporary philosophies of the human mind, in order to interpret supernatural entities as manifestations of tyranny, repressed desire, and fear of ‘the Other’. We will connect these historical and cultural changes with formal and generic developments in the literature of the period, paying particular attention to the way that Victorian writers re-imagined tropes such as the natural landscape, anti-hero, and angel/whore dichotomy for a new age. The module will culminate by questioning the extent to which the sublime and ‘explained supernatural’ not only uncover cultural anxieties, but also promote education, reform and the toleration of difference as their most powerful remedy.",,,,,,"The lectures introduce students to knowledge outcomes relevant to the module. They address themes common to the authors studied and encourage the students to think comparatively. The seminars allow for the development of knowledge outcomes through close reading of specified texts, and the practice of skills, especially oral presentation and interpersonal communication. In addition, between the lecture and the seminar, students will be required to participate in a self-directed group learning hour. In the course of the module, each student will be responsible for writing at least two study group reports.
Seminars develop this knowledge and enable the practise of skills, namely close textual analysis and interpersonal communications.  Study groups give students the chance to develop independent study and prepare for the seminars in terms that give them genuine ownership over the material.","In the formative assignment, students will be required to plan an essay that links at least two texts that they have studied on the module. In this plan they will be expected to apply their understanding of the sublime and 'explained supernatural' in order to explore particular forms of cultural anxiety, and how these are reflected in, or challenged by, their chosen texts.

The formative assignment will:
1. Encourage student engagement with the module themes by reflecting critically upon their learning.
2. Require students to develop research skills as they seek out additional primary and secondary sources to compile their research plan and annotated bibliography.
3. Prepare students for their final essay in a way that allows them to receive constructive feedback and engage with it before beginning the assignment.

The end of module essay (3,500 words) will ask students to write an essay that engages with least two different texts, and responds to one or more given keywords.

The North East is one of the historic birthplaces of literacy in the British Isles, though it has also often been marginalised from the centralised culture of the English literary establishment. This module will explore the fate of North East writing (in the broadest sense) from the post-Victorian era to the twenty-first century, a time when the region's slow industrial decline was offset by a series of experiments in imaginative idealism, energetic realism and countercultural eccentricity. 

We will try to assess whether the modern history of North East cultural production offers any clues as to how the region and its people might move forward in the socially, environmentally and constitutionally vexed climate of the twenty-first century.

In the eighteenth century, the genre of utopian literature expanded dramatically. Writers, poets, political philosophers, and even revolutionaries took up the concept, exploring its value to society and confronting its limitations. With Europe shaken to its core by the French Revolution of 1789, there were some who believed that utopia might actually be within the grasp of humanity, while others recognised the potential dark side of an idealism that reached for perfection.

Engaging with a range of different kinds of texts, including early novelistic forms, political prose, philosophy, and poetry, we will explore questions around the nature of utopia as it is conceived by the authors.

How does theatre represent and embody emotional experience? What kinds of impact can performance have on our bodies, as well as our minds? This module explores these questions and many others as it reflects on theatre's capacity to generate 'all the feels'. It examines what we know about how performance communicates and provokes physical and emotional responses such as laughter, tears, fear, thrill and delight. It offers an overview of the representation of emotion and the crafting of affect in contemporary performance in order to provide opportunities to reflect on performance’s role and function in contemporary culture.

The module involves analysis of live and recorded performance as well as scripts, engaging with a number of productions and plays across a range of genres and forms. It places these ‘primary texts’ in dialogue with broader theoretical issues including the definition of affect and the ways in which theatrical methods of depicting emotion have changed over time. These theories provide a framework for viewing, reading and analysing a range of contemporary plays and performances that are explicitly designed to have a strong emotional and affective impact. They allow us to assess the role that convention and codification play in the staging and experience of emotion, as well as how collective audience experience can heighten or inflect the emotional and physical responses of spectators.

The end of term assessment involves a  choice of three different modes of assessment. 

Students can either: 

1) offer a critically and theoretically informed analysis of the examples contemporary performance covered on the module in an academic essay, 

2) present an individual performance presentation which engages with the issues raised on the module and offers a critically informed creative response to the forms of contemporary performance viewed on the module. This performance presentation will be accompanied by a critical reflective commentary that provides an opportunity for students to present the independent research leading to the presentation, to reflect upon their own learning, and indicate how their creative response may be subjected to critical and/or theoretical analysis.

3) write a short script for live performance which engages with the issues raised on the module and offers a critically informed creative response to the forms of contemporary performance viewed on the module. This will be accompanied by a critical reflective commentary that provides an opportunity for students to present the independent research undertaken during the script's development, to reflect upon their own learning, and indicate how their creative response may be subjected to critical and/or theoretical analysis.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/elll/,

Geography is characterised by a breadth of subject matter that examines the relationships between physical and human aspects of spaces, environments and landscapes.  Human geography focuses on the spatial relationships of human activities, and particularly on how social, economic, political and cultural processes and relationships are formed and expressed geographically.  Physical geography is the study of the Earth’s surface and near-surface environment and focusses on explaining the processes and spatial patterns in the Earth’s hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere and lithosphere.  This module offers an introduction to some of the methods and philosophies that are used in geographical research.  The module is wide-ranging and will cover a diverse set of methods appropriate for the collection, analysis and presentation of human and physical geographical data.
Module aims:
•        To consider the nature of geographical data and the methods for their collection, analysis, presentation and mapping
•        To describe quantitative and qualitative methods and approaches to geographical analysis using real-world examples and project work

In the eventuality that the residential field course is not possible due to travel restrictions (Covid-19), the module team will deliver a programme of guided activities (live in-person and/or live online, as appropriate) at the end of which students will complete presentations.",,,,,,"The first lecture will act as an introduction to the field course and the socio-political context of Cyprus-Nicosia. The following lectures will introduce theories and concepts relevant to political geography and, crucially, the context of Nicosia and Cyprus. Possible topics students might explore in their research projects/presentations will be outlined here. During these sessions students will form groups and identify a broad topic they wish to explore in Nicosia/at home through secondary research (COVID-19 dependent). The final lecture before the trip will address issues related to undertaking research on geopolitically-sensitive issues – methodological approaches, methods, ethics and other associated practicalities (e.g. working in groups). After the lectures the students will partake in a number of workshop sessions (a 2 hour reading exercise in the format of a seminar; a 1 hour research project development session and a 2 hour session for formative presentations). 

The organised activities and independent research undertaken on days 4-6 of the trip will require students to utilise a range of research methods (e.g. formulating questions for interviews, undertaking ethnography, writing a field diary and conducting participant observation); these activities will be reflected on each evening through formative group activities that will act as preparation for the final presentations. The assorted activities will provide students with opportunities to explore modes of learning and research geographical issues beyond the university. Both before and after the fieldtrip, students will be encouraged to dedicate time to reading and the development of knowledge and understanding.

The organised programme of workshops, scheduled online seminars and small group teaching (in the eventuality that we need to remain in Newcastle) will require students to use a range secondary research methods; these activities will be reflected on throughout the programme of events through formative activities that will act as preparation for the final presentations.

Please note, all teaching on this module has been listed as PiP (if this is possible when the module runs. If not, online live delivery will be utilised) as the sessions are highly interactive (student-staff, student-student and staff-staff interaction). The sessions offer a chance for students to get to know one another and work together in groups to design their research projects alongside staff members. The dynamic format of the sessions switching between standard lecture delivery, plenary discussions and breakout groups, means that there are sound pedagogical reasons for aspiring to PiP teaching sessions for this module.","Before embarking on the field class in Nicosia/the week of activities in Newcastle or online, all students will be required to give a formative presentation. This will include a review of relevant literature situated in political geography (e.g. urban, everyday, popular, peace, youth geopolitics, nationalism, proto-states, ‘no-man’s land’, tourism and the geopolitical etc.) Students will be given a choice of topics to focus on drawn from the themes introduced during the preliminary lectures. This exercise will enable students to ground their knowledge in the relevant readings (some of which will be focused on the case of Cyprus, others on debates in political geography and geopolitics more widely) and to begin to develop more advanced knowledge of their chosen topic ahead of the trip. 

During the fieldtrip/activities in Newcastle or online, students will be required to produce a 10-minute presentation (accounting for 40% of the module mark). The presentations will report on the independent research projects undertaken by students throughout the week (thematic focus of the research will be decided beforehand and will involve primary/secondary research as appropriate). Students will be given adequate guidance in terms of structure (i.e. introduction, research questions, existing debates-literature, methodology, main findings/data analysis and conclusions) and the practicalities of giving presentations.

Their future behaviour is crucial for predicting sea level rise and changes in water resources, as well as acting as a barometer for further climatic warming.

This module will provide a comprehensive introduction to the key features and processes associated with glaciers and glaciated landscapes. The aims are to:
•        Outline the processes that govern glacier flow and form;
•        Explore the characteristics of the world’s major ice masses and evaluate the factors determining their response to climate change;
•        Understand how glaciated landscapes are created and to use this record to interpret the behaviour of past glaciers and its relationship with climatic conditions.
•        Evaluate different approaches to managing the cryopshere;
•        Provide practical experience of geographic information systems (GIS) and their application to glaciology.
•        Develop capacity to present ideas in written and oral form, to debate important issues and to synthesize information from the published literature and practical exercises.

Students will be introduced to the mechanisms by which glaciers flow and the fundamental processes governing their behaviour. The course will then highlight the contemporary issues and state-of-the-art knowledge in the major glaciated regions, specifically Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic ice caps, the Himalaya, the European Alps, New Zealand and Alaska. There will be a particular focus on contemporary response of these ice masses to climate change. Finally, the course will outline the ways in which glaciers shape the landscape and how this can be used to reconstruct past glacier behaviour, which is highly relevant for contextualising contemporary ice loss.

The module will provide the students with skills in geographic information systems (GIS) and enable them to work with the remotely sensed datasets that are used in contemporary glaciological research. It will also develop transferable skills, particularly communication and interpersonal skills.",,,,,,"Lectures will provide the fundamental knowledge and understanding framework required for the course. They will cover four main topic areas: 1) glacial processes; 2) the contemporary cryosphere and climate change; 3) glaciated landscapes and paleoglaciology and; 4) managing glacial areas. These will be supported by structured guided learning activities related to each lecture. The exact format will depend on the lecture, but examples include: 1) asking students to write a short formative summary, based on a structured reading list; an online quiz to check understanding; analysis of a dataset used in the lecture; virtual field courses, using pre-developed external materials.

Practical sessions will introduce students to important datasets and techniques used in contemporary glaciological research. The students will be trained how to access and process these datasets using GIS. They will then learn to apply their results to understand glacier behaviour, response to climate forcing and to reconstruct the behaviour of past ice masses. Students will use detailed hand-out sheets and videos to work independently through the practicals, which will be supported by present in person drop-in sessions and discussion boards.

The seminar will allow students to discuss the most appropriate ways of managing glacial environments.

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",River Catchment Dynamics,20,Dr Matthew Perks,"Rationale: Water is naturally transferred and circulated between stores in the earth’s atmosphere, across the earth’s surface, within the pores of soil, and through geological structures. This circulation of water is a global phenomenon known as the hydrological cycle, and is key in driving not just the movement of water, but also dissolved constituents, pollutants, and solid material from the earth’s surface to terminating environments (e.g. seas and lakes). The movement of these materials affect the climate, availability of water resources, aquatic pollution, and propensity for flood related hazards. These are all critical issues for sustainably managing natural resources and mitigating against water-related hazards in the 21st Century.

Aims: This module aims to: (1) introduce you to catchment science, the movement of water and associated material across the earth’s surface, and to demonstrate how this drives river systems; (2) provide an understanding of how human activity can modify catchment processes and river response (e.g. land-use change, dam construction, flood management); and (3) provide experience of techniques used to measure and model catchment processes, and in the analysis of catchment fluxes.

This module provides students with the theoretical background relating to river catchment processes. The module is designed to: (a) explore catchment processes in significantly greater depth than material introduced in GEO1020 (Introduction to Physical Geography); (b) provide essential theoretical background for students undertaking dissertation research on hydrological processes, complementing the GEO2127 dissertation planning module; (c) provide an essential knowledge-base for students wishing to undertake Stage 3 modules relating to hydrology or fluvial geomorphology.",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce key concepts and theories across a range of catchment process themes along with case studies which are used to illustrate their occurrence.

The first series of computer practical classes will allow students to gain experience of investigating the processes occurring across river catchments. These are designed to facilitate higher-order cognitive behaviour such as assessing and evaluating interactions between multiple variables. Each practical session shares a theme with a lecture and these pairings enable students to delve deeper into the concepts and theories introduced. Prior to each of these practical sessions, a 30-minute lecture is provided to introduce the task and the learning objectives.

The second series of computer practical classes will allow students to gain experience of analysing secondary datasets. These data have been collected to enable detection of changes in catchment processes over time. Completion of these practical sessions will provide students with the opportunity to develop their skills in mapping (GIS) and statistical analysis.","The synoptic essay will examine the lecture-based knowledge gained by students. Lectures, supplemented by student reading, impart the essential knowledge base for this and other follow-on modules (fieldtrips, dissertation) and it is appropriate to formally test this knowledge.

The report assesses the ability of students to analyse and interpret secondary field-data. The report assesses their ability to relate field results to literature and develop an informed and critical argument. The field report assesses formal written communication skills and report writing style.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/gps/,

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Humans vs Nature in the Netherlands (Netherlands Field course),20,Dr Maarten van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol,"The Netherlands are one of the most densely populated parts of the world and the physical landscape has been heavily adapted by humans. This makes it an ideal location to study how coastal processes and river dynamics in the delta of the rivers Meuse and Rhine have been changed to make them suitable for safe habitation by humans. The module will provide insight into how people have initially been fighting against nature and more recently have been working with nature to ensure the long-term safety of places to live and produce crops. The module will look at issues of flooding, land subsidence, water quality, and biodiversity loss and how these have to be balanced. Students will be stimulated to think critically about how it is possible to balance the demands of different stakeholders in this highly complex landscape that requires detailed and long-term planning.

2.        To develop advanced fieldwork focused skills, including research design, data collection techniques and data interpretation, which can applied to other modules, particularly the dissertation (GEO3099).
3.        To facilitate students making the linkage between knowledge gained from the literature and classroom-based learning, with field based research. This includes the limitations and challenges faced when translating theoretical ideas into practical fieldwork.
4.        To give students the opportunity to build on the skills and knowledge gained from the GEO2137 (Key Methods in Physical Geography), through targeted primary data collection and landscape-scale interpretation.
5.        To enhance teamwork and interpersonal skills, through working together and planning fieldwork in a complex and potentially challenging environment.",,,,,,"1. Lectures and staff-led field days introduce, develop and illustrate the environmental history of the study area and the key geomorphological concepts relevant to the field course. Student-led presentations (in pairs) at field sites will help students focus on specific elements of the field sites.
2. Fieldwork provides opportunities for student-led design and planning of geomorphological research as teams of 4-5 students and to collect data. Training in fieldwork techniques and assistance in project design will be available from staff.
3. Post-trip seminar and computer practical aimed at analysis, interpretation and integration of data, with two additional scheduled drop-in sessions for questions about final written assessment.","There will be group presentations (20% of overall module mark) during the fieldtrip, allowing the students to present initial results and to reflect on the development and execution of small-scale research projects. This will enable them to develop their thinking in advance of the field reports and to critically evaluate their work and approach, which will be beneficial for future projects, particularly the dissertation. It will improve their capacity to present information orally and visually and to work effectively as part of a team. The presentations will be carried out on the last evening of the fieldtrip. This is to ensure that the students have the maximum amount of time in the field and time in the evenings to process and collate their field data, but also trains the students to prioritise and work efficiently in limited time available. Students will also, in pairs, prepare a short presentation of one of the sites visited during the trip (10% of overall module mark) as a ‘flipped classroom’ approach, to help students focus and prepare in advance for the field sites.

A field report is used as main assessment type (70% of overall module mark) as it assesses the key skills and knowledge outcomes we wish to achieve during the course, specifically it allows students to:
1.       Demonstrate their research design for the field data collection.
2.       Show that they have selected and understood appropriate methodologies.
3.       Synthesise and interpret their field results, in relation to the published literature.
4.       Critically evaluate their field approaches and the literature.
5.       Demonstrate understanding of the main processes operating in a complex landscape where humans have strongly impacted natural coastal and riverine processes, and the tensions between different components and stakeholders in this landscape.
6.       Show their capacity to write concisely, effectively and scientifically and to use appropriate graphics (e.g. graphs and maps) to support their argument.

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Global Challenges (Inactive),20,Professor Rachel Pain,"This module focuses on the nature, impacts and resolution of global challenges to humanity and our environments in the twenty-first century. It covers relevant concepts, a number of in-depth case studies, and the responses of policy-makers, communities and other actors. It teaches some key examples of global challenges that are based on the current research interests of staff. It encourages students to take a critical approach to what a global challenge is, why some become visible issues to be dealt with while others don’t, and the ways in which challenges at different scales, sites and timeframes are connected. 

The module therefore focuses on a number of topical global issues from both human and physical geography. These will vary from year to year but examples include domestic violence, climate change, sea level rise, global pandemics, urban sustainability, pollution, energy, migration, flooding, financial crisis, and the new Cold War. These issues are taught in an integrated and interdisciplinary way, rather than as closed systems or constrained by sub-disciplinary areas. Examples used come from both Global North and South, and the interrelations and interdependencies of these and other sites and scales will be demonstrated. 

Along these lines, the introductory lecture will set out a conceptual framework for understanding global challenges. The non-lecture activities and assessments will also encourage students to think about global challenges in this way.

On successful completion of the module, students will have an in-depth understanding of a range of contemporary global challenges, be able to assess their impacts on humanity and our environments, be able to understand the connections between different global challenges, and be able to critically appraise why certain issues become prominent at certain times and in certain places.

Students are asked to select two of the issues featured in the blocks taught on the module, and write the news feature following some specific guidelines that will be given about content and style. The assessment workshop linked to this assignment will explain what is required, and work with students to understand what makes an excellent news feature article. 

The rationale for Assessment 1 is to 
(a)        encourage students to research two issues from the module in more depth. 
(b)        encourage students to reflect across the two issues – the similarities, differences and connections between two current global challenges and how they are being, or could be, tackled.
(c)        develop and practice the skill of journalistic writing for informed popular audiences. 

Specific assessment criteria will be provided for Assessment 2. 

Assessment 2 is an unseen examination.

•        To give students the opportunity to apply their learning and experience during the module in the development of individual reports that will ask them to synthesise their conceptual understanding, empirical research and personal reflections.",,,,,,"The preparatory series of five sessions are sequenced so as to move from lecture through to workshop style delivery. The initial lectures facilitate the imparting of practical information around the module structure, expectations, modes of teaching and assessment. These are also important for familiarising students with the empirical landscape and issues, as there is no expectation that students will have prior knowledge of these. The lectures then progress to a more hybrid lecture/workshop format in the discussion of concepts before moving more fully to workshop format in the final two weeks as students form groups and develop their chosen project ideas with support from the lecturing staff. 

During this time students will also be involved in their own independent study, engaging with set readings from the module whilst also identifying materials pertinent and specific to their own research projects as these develop and evolve. 

The fieldtrip itself provides the opportunity for students to apply their learning from the lectures, their independent study and the preparations they have made in order to successfully execute their research in the field. This provides the opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned and how they prepared beyond the abstract setting of the University. As the students move towards summative evaluation, greater time will be dedicated to ‘assessment preparation and completion'. 

A final post-fieldtrip workshop will allow students to discuss the research process, reflect on their findings, share data and ask practical questions relating to the second summative assessment (report).","In the final week of the series of five preparatory lectures/workshops, all students will be required to give a  group oral presentation. This will be formatively assessed, with students receiving qualitative group feedback on their presentations before departure to the field site. The purpose of this assessment is fourfold:

-        firstly, to encourage students to focus their energies and to formulate meaningful and sustainable research topics at an early stage; 
-        secondly, to familiarise students with the Oral Examination form of assessment at an early stage, providing a testing ground for the subsequent summative version;
-        thirdly, to give students an opportunity to test and probe the viability of research topics at a stage at which it will still be possible for them to reassess these as appropriate in advance of the fieldtrip itself;
-        and fourthly, to give non-presenting students an experience and expectation of what is required of them in terms of commenting on, and providing constructive and collegiate feedback to their peers.

The summative oral presentation, which will take place towards the end of the fieldtrip itself, therefore provides a logical progression from the formative pre-departure version. Students will be asked to collaborate on, and develop their 15-minute presentation with reference to supporting media, that could include a poster or visual/audio material of their choosing. This provides a methodological progression from the formative version, allowing the students to experiment and to extend their presentational skills in a collaborative context. This Oral Examination constitutes 25% of the overall module grade.

The terminal report, accounting for 75% of the overall marks for the module, provides the opportunity for individual students to demonstrate their contextual understanding and application of appropriate concepts and methodologies in addressing a valid and viable research topic. At this stage in the research process, students should have gathered sufficient materials, and absorbed a variety of secondary materials sufficient for this activity to act as a natural progression for them in allowing them to follow their own unique and independent research questions and instincts.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/gps/,

These changes are expected to have significant global environmental impacts.

This module aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of polar environments and how they are changing. The module aims are as follows:
•        Examine the physical processes responsible for present-day change in polar environments;
•        Outline the past record of polar environmental change and how it can help inform understanding of present-day polar environments;
•        Evaluate the possible impact of warmer future polar environments;

•        Teach methods for assessing, analysing and integrating environmental data to investigate and understand polar environments
•        Provide training in data assessment, description, integration, interpretation, and report writing.

Students will be introduced to the fundamental processes which drive the environment and cryosphere of polar environments. Topical, high impact issues (e.g. ice sheet dynamics, melting sea ice, thawing permafrost, methane release etc.) will likely be used to outline the mechanisms behind current environmental change, to assess the likely future behaviour of such systems, and investigate the impacts of these changes on the Earth System. The impact of changing Polar Environments, on both ecosystems and human activities will likely be outlined.

In this module, it is intended that a strong emphasis will be placed on the hands-on use and analysis of data from polar environments. The aim is to will provide students with critical transferable geographical skills (e.g. geo-visualisation, handling of large and complex geo-data, data assessment, description and interpretation) and the ability to analyse and interpret the observations that underpin our current understanding of polar environments.",,,,,,"Lectures will provide an introduction to the present state of the Polar Environments, how they may change in the future, and what impact this may have on the global system.

Practical sessions will be used to introduce students to the methods and data used to measure and observe present- day polar environments.

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Landslides and coasts,20,Dr Stuart Dunning,"Mountainous relief is generated by the interaction of tectonics and climate, with the balance responsible for the net change of a landscape’s relief and elevation. The potential of rivers and glaciers to erode (or protect) mountainous landscapes in response to tectonic and climatic forcing has been the focus of much work, with hillslope processes often assumed to respond to, and reflect, undercutting by either process. These hillslope processes undertake the geomorphic work above rivers and ice that lower mountain peaks and retreats valley sides, providing sediment to be mobilized from orogens, therefore playing a key role in controlling relief and elevation. The ability of landslides to transfer sufficient mass to keep pace with fluvial and glacial downcutting and tectonic uplift is not well constrained and is dependent upon characterising their long-term magnitude-frequency. This magnitude-frequency has direct implications for those living, or passing through steep terrain, and those tasked with minimising the threats to life and infrastructure though avoidance, or engineering. Ultimately, the fate of much of this sediment is the Ocean store, via an interrupted pathway with potential sediment sinks in valley floors and lakes. The final critical zone that regulates sediment supply to the deeper oceans is the coast. Here, the interplay between fluvial, terrestrial, and marine processes dictates ultimately whether sediments are transported to the deep ocean, accumulate in prograding terrestrial beach ridges or sand dunes, or move in perpetuity between subaerial and subaqueous zones through the action of coastal storms. The coast can therefore act as a source of sediment through processes such as coastal cliff erosion, with much of our risk from mass movements in the UK confined to this narrow zone, but also a sink with clear transport pathways to the deep ocean. This module will explore the conceptual models of long-term slope evolution, our approaches to monitoring and modelling failure, and the varied approaches to landslide hazard and risk mitigation/management.

Aims: This module aims to develop knowledge and understanding of the principles, theory and practice of hillslope and coastal professionals and researchers, applied geomorphology, monitoring and modelling, and, varied approaches to engineering or societal mitigation.",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce key concepts across a range of spatial and temporal time-scales, and will utilise research and professional practice case-study examples. 

Fieldwork will enable students to be trained in the use of cutting-edge data collection techniques and interpreting these data, and their practical application in mitigating landslide hazard and risk. 

Practical classes will allow students to process data, collect from fieldwork, analyse secondary data and recommend solutions – all based on real-world situations. the sessions allow students to learn experientially the key skills applicable for further research or employment in linked industries.

Drop in sessions (online) linked to discussion boards will provide support with the practical completions and assessment preparation, as will a number lectures with in-class time devoted to assessment/practical support.","The report assesses the ability of students to design an appropriate study, collect, analyze and present a range of primary and secondary data, and set this within the theoretical and practice context.

The problem with this is these records are too short to critically examine the full range of climate behaviour and variability. As a result, there is great uncertainty in how future climate may respond in a warming world.  

Palaeoclimatology is the study of climate prior to the widespread availability of records of temperature, precipitation and other instrumental data. It has been key in showing us how Earth's climate system can shift dramatically between different climate states. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms of these switches in climate state over different timescales is critical to anticipating potential human-driven climate change.

The aim of this module is to introduce students to Earth’s extraordinarily broad range of climate variability, and to provide them with an understanding of the mechanisms of climate change. In addition, the module also discusses how we can reconstruct past climate using a range of proxy indicators, the chronological constraints on palaeoclimate records, and how these are integrated to understand climate change and climate sensitivity.",,,,,,"Lectures, workshops and inquiry-based learning will complement each other in providing both a theoretical background and practical training in the analysis of palaeoclimatological data, as well as providing breadth of subject area. Lectures are planned to deliver the background to palaeoclimate concepts, with dedicated technique lectures reinforcing the concepts of a palaeoclimatologists “toolbox” i.e. how we use proxies and their limitations, and the inquiry-based learning provides opportunities to handle real palaeoclimate data and to interrogate it.","The essay will test theoretical knowledge of the subject and breadth of understanding of palaeoclimate data.

Opinion polls routinely collect popular assessments of leaders, while valence politics renders attitudes towards political leaders increasingly electorally salient. The diaries, autobiographies, and biographies of leaders reach wide audiences. However, much of the discussion and assessment of leadership in Britain is insular and atheoretical. This module therefore aims to examine political leadership in Britain by reference to a range of theoretical debates in political science and kindred disciplines.",,,,,,"The pre-recorded video content introduces students to the careers of the 14 post-war UK prime ministers to be studied in the module. 

The in-person lectures introduce students to the key topics of the module. 

The present in person seminars are designed to actively engage students in critical discussion of the core theoretical, conceptual, and empirical concerns of the module.","Students will complete two 2,000 word essays, each of which will account for 50% of the final mark for the module.

The first of these will analyse one individual leader in depth using the theories and concepts introduced and examined in the module.

The second essay will require students to select a theoretical approach to the study of political leadership. Students will then critically evaluate that perspective by applying it to several British political leaders studied in the module.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/gps/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",International Politics and Urbanism (Inactive),20,Dr Matt Davies,Conventional theories of international relations tend to define the space for politics as within the territorial national state and the state as the important agent international relations. Critiques of conventional theories highlight the important spaces and agents that this narrow conception excludes. This module takes up this critique by exploring the role that cities and urbanization play in shaping world politics and the international agents and forces shaping urbanism. The module aims to enable students to explain contemporary urban politics outside the limits of methodological nationalism and international relations from the perspective of the prospects of transversal forms of politics.,,,,,,"Lectures will present students with analyses of contemporary and historical processes of urbanism in relation to world politics and critiques of scholarship on these phenomena (learning outcomes 1, 2, and 5).

3)       critically discuss the 20th century mainstream of international political theory/IR theory, analyse how it developed and consider how it impacted on practical thinking in international politics

Original Summary:
The module “International Political Thought” is based on “classical” texts of political philosophers and international legal theorists thematising international politics. Representative authors will be selected from the Greek and Roman antiquity, the European Middle Ages, and the 16th, 17th and 18th century.

• Develop students’ understandings of the historical and contemporary roles that gender and sexuality have played in the politics of the region – from colonialism to the present day.
• Empower students to critically engage with questions of gender and sexuality in the Middle East from feminist perspectives. 
• Encourage students to reflect on the importance of positionality within academic study.",,,,,,"The lectures will be organised around a specific theme. They will introduce students to key concepts and ideas, regional trends, as well as specific case studies. These case studies will be varied across the course, exposing students to a wide range of contexts, including both Arab-majority and non-Arab majority contexts. Seminars will involve the discussion of key readings and case studies, and will facilitate a critical engagement with the subject matter. The online Q&A session provides an opportunity for student consultation and feedback, as well as for offering guidance on topics such as assessments. This is complemented by students’ guided independent study. 
Overall, these teaching methods will support students in developing their knowledge of gender and sexuality politics in the region and their ability to approach and analyse the topics at hand from feminist perspectives. Critical analytical thinking and written communication skills are further developed through the assessments. Time management, planning and organisational skills are developed throughout the module.","Assessment Rationale and Relationship:
The case study (25%) will develop and test students’ independent research skills and their ability to draw links between academic concepts and a case study of relevance to the course.

The essay (75%) will allow students the opportunity for more in-depth exploration and to develop their skills of feminist analysis of gender and sexuality. Through this assignment, they will be able to demonstrate in-depth knowledge, understanding and analysis of relevant concepts and empirical events. 

Taken together, the two assignments ensure that students will engage with multiple aspects of the course, and both will assess critical thinking, written communication, and argumentation.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/gps/,

This module will explore the role of institutions in providing health care to citizens/residents and their influence on health status. Students will be introduced to political science studies on health policy and politics to explain cross-country variation in health care provision/access and health outcomes. We will be examining current data on health systems and health outcomes from different European countries, including the UK.

The module has thus four main aims:  
1.        To introduce students to political science theories of health policy development 
2.        To develop students’ awareness of different health care systems in Europe

The module aims to introduce students to the debates within academic research regarding how we can understand the different dimensions of public policy from agenda-setting to implementation and the key factors which shape these processes. The module will provide students with a detailed knowledge and understanding of the changing nature of policy analysis and it relates to contemporary debates and practical challenges facing policy-makers. The module will have a UK focus but examples will also be drawn from the comparative public policy literature and experience. Using contemporary examples of policy problems – for example these may include but are not restricted to, climate change, COVID-19 responses, the creation of the NHS, the international spread of smoking bans – the module explores the lifecycle of public policies. Throughout the course links to employability and transferable skills, and specifically how policy concepts can help us make policy in practice will be discussed.",,,,,,"The lectures will introduce students to the key terms, concepts, and texts in the study of public policy. They will be divided into three main sections – public policy, theories and actors, followed a section where skills are emphasised, before moving on to a third bloc with an emphasis on case studies which allow students to apply their knowledge to actual policy problems. Non-synchronous summaries after each group of lectures (theories, skills and cases) will allow students to consolidate their knowledge, and revisit these lessons as appropriate. Small group teaching will provide a live, synchronous environment in which students can discuss readings, and apply their theoretical and critical insights to current policy problems, while at the same time permitting problem solving and teamwork within groups. The module will aim to bring the policy environment to life for students through an annual guest lecture by a policy practitioner. Structured, guided learning activities will include quizzes to allow students to check their understandings of aspects and approaches to public policy; guided tasks, including with primary sources such as policy documents and post-implementation inquiries, and data where appropriate, will encourage deeper reflection on the practical difficulties of developing and implementing public policies.","The emphasis on transferable skills and employability in the module is carried through into the coursework assessment, with students asked to write a policy briefing dealing with their evidence-based recommendations for dealing with a particular public policy problem chosen from a list provided, although with the approval of the module convenor students will be given the option of identifying a different policy problem to deal with. This is typical of the type of analysis students may be asked to undertake post-graduation, and this experience will equip them well from the viewpoint of employability. This is also a highly intellectually challenging exercise, as it necessitates dealing with theories and evidence in a very different way to a standard essay. Support and advice will be provided for students in developing this new and innovative form of writing in these policy briefings. While coursework allows specialisation, the online open book examination will be run on Canvas during the assessment period at the end of the module. It will be scheduled by exam timetabling and seek to test the broad levels of knowledge gain throughout the module.

This involves students encountering the foundations of sociology (theories, processes and structures), its key concepts, and their application to the study of social institutions and social divisions.
We will explore questions like: what are the differences between the micro and the macro levels of social life? What are the distinctions between the public and the private, and how do they blur into each other? What does it mean to say that an approach is taking an essentialist view or a social constructed one? What are the implications of believing that social structures do not allow individuals to decide what they can do and achieve? How do norms, regulations, networks and social relations organize social order or spark conflict in contemporary societies? What is ‘everyday life’ and common sense understanding?

In terms of introducing key debates, the module will introduce students to particular perspectives of inequalities. It will explore representations of crime and criminal justice and this may include police recording procedures and statistical data and dramatic media constructions of dastardly villains and heroic law-enforcement (or vice versa); the impact of class, gender, ethnicity, age and their various interactions and combinations on crime; and various aspects of the criminal justice system (such as police, prosecutors, courts and sentencing, punishments and the role of victims).

The module will explore the concept of governmentality and how it is enacted in Modern and Neoliberal states, with particular focus on the role of the individual and the governance of the self and risk-management, as well as the tools of the State, especially the New Penology.

In order to fully understand these processes, students will first be grounded in the Sociological, Philosophical and Criminological literatures that have informed and produced both the tools of neoliberalism themselves, and critical accounts of those tools. 

It is expected that this module will provide students with an introduction to the sociology of crime and a deeper understanding of control processes, which will inform their second and third year modules, including their dissertations.

The first half of the module starts with classic control theories, alongside debates between social constructionist and realist theories of crime and deviance (review from SOC1034). Key authors and texts, such as David Garland’s (2002) The Culture of Control, helps students historicise punishment, crime control and social control. Crucially students will explore how crime control dominates how ‘social problems ‘such as poverty are produced, framed and dealt with in neoliberal states, through for example penal punitiveness and ‘law and order’ populism. 

The second half of the module begins with an examination of how the ‘self’ is governed and disciplined in neoliberal states, drawing on Michel Foucault’s body of work.

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Understanding Social Change and Transformation,20,Dr Emma Clavering,"This module is an introduction to the history of ideas in sociology and in anthropology, exploring some of the main theoretical traditions in the two disciplines as they have developed over the past century and more. Taking a broadly chronological approach, we examine in turn how these disciplines emerged as distinctive approaches for trying to understand our changing world, and how their founding assumptions and ideas have been challenged and revised over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

Classical sociology and social anthropology came into being in response to and as part of the major transformation in the Western world that we call modernity, a set of historical shifts associated with the rise of rationality and science, industrial production and urbanisation, democracy and the nation- state, capitalism and individualism. Classical sociology was born out of attempts of European white men to describe and analyse changes within their own societies, and to do so systematically - even scientifically. Social anthropology, on the other hand, developed out of a fascination with the (often colonial) other, with forms of social organisation, institutions, practices and ways of being that were profoundly different from the West. But how could these different systems be understood?

This module aims to examine how we can use enduring traditions and ongoing theoretical debates in sociology and social anthropology to understand a changing and increasingly globalising world. Is the idea of ‘modernity’ still relevant to understanding societies and social change? Is it still possible to understand societies near and far objectively – was it ever? Are we moving into a new era ‘after’ modernity? What frameworks and ideas do we need to understand a range of contemporary societies, their institutions and ideas, and the identities and forms of life they offer us?",,,,,,"The combination of lectures, workshops and seminars is suitable to offering an in-depth understanding of the topics covered in the module. The lectures will introduce students to key theoretical approaches. These will be explored and discussed in more detail in the workshops and student-led seminars. Seminars are organised around exploring both the ideas of major theorists and significant themes and concepts in sociology and social anthropology based on set reading which students are expected to undertake in preparation. This mix enables students to build up relevant knowledges while practicing key disciplinary and transferable skills. There will be assignment workshops in which students can explore the key features of the assessment requirements and discuss ideas and raise questions as appropriate. As a compulsory module the materials covered in this module are foundational to student understandings of sociology and anthropology and so the extra 4 hours are justified. In addition, there will be an optional film series to further stimulate students to think critically about topical issues.

It is not surprising, then, that this is an enduring area of interest for researchers studying social arenas as varied as, for example, the use and exchange of ritual goods, and social and cultural values ascribed to lifestyle choices.

It seeks to provide an overview of the main debates informing current anthropological interest, alongside key sociological texts where relevant. It will draw on key theoretical insights to help reflect on consumer cultures, such as how things and people are classified, ways in which artefacts speak to us through shared signs and symbols, and perceptions of social and cultural identities. 

The study of consumer culture encourages us to consider the interplay across local and global spheres of life, as well as aspects of everyday lives at the individual, family, and community level. As such it helps contextualise intimate decisions, and provide an active social arena in which key theoretical debates can be critically assessed. This complexity will be examined in detail through case studies based on the module’s main intersecting themes, including ritual and celebration, family worlds, popular culture and social media, consuming health and the body, virtual/digital consuming, and ethical choices.

The main objectives are:
To introduce students to the context and variety of current anthropological debates on consumer practices.
To develop students’ understanding of key sociological theories around cultures of consumption.
To explore, through case studies, concepts of social and cultural value.
To encourage students’ critical reading of ethnographic texts and media images.
To develop students’ skills to argue logically and analytically both orally in group discussions, and in writing for their assessments.",,,,,,"Lectures are intended to combine theoretical concepts with substantive material around anthropological and sociological understandings of consumption.

There are 4 x hour-long films students are invited to watch independently chosen to exemplify key themes. These will be included in seminar discussions where appropriate to encourage students to evaluate ways in which media resources compare to peer- reviewed academic texts.

Seminars are held every other week to pick up on a key theme. These are designed to provide students with structured tasks and readings. Students will be encouraged to discuss their analysis of key texts with their peers.

Pre recorded material will include general top tips on assignments.

The 2 hour workshop will focus on supporting students with the Case Study (Assignment 2)

One of the seminars will be designed around preparing students for the independent observation. Students will be able to share their insights from the observation with their peers in a subsequent seminar. 

The observation provides students with an opportunity to observe consumption practices in a familiar context using ethnographic tools. This will allow students to put into practice concepts introduced in lectures and seminar discussions, while gaining an introduction to the experience of being an observer, to help them reflect on ways in which ethnographic texts are produced (and, indeed, consumed).","The Essay allows the in-depth exploration of key theoretical insights introduced in the first half of the module. It will assess student knowledge of concepts, with a particular emphasis on local and global consumption practices.

The Case Study will build on the skills the level 2 students are starting to develop in their academic career. It will give students the opportunity to take a theme of their choice, and explore it in detail. This exercise requires them to engage with a range of relevant anthropological and sociological literature around their chosen case study, and to consider the relevance of this subject for the future.

Therefore, both assignments (Essay & Case Study) test learning outcomes with regard to both knowledge and skills.

Both assignments are preceded by formative assessment plans, which are optional for students.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/gps/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Researching Social Life I,20,Dr Chris Moreh,"Sociology is based on systematic knowledge about the social world that we inhabit. ‘Researching Social Life I’ introduces the range of ways that sociologists do research by collecting empirical information so that they can develop their sociological ideas. Its core theme is the importance of evidence: the way we collect and analyse information has a huge effect on our research findings. Data analysis is a practical activity, and therefore the module is distinctive in involving a series of hands-on computer labs and seminars, as well as being focused on practical assignments. It is in these applied sessions that you will convert the principles explained in the lectures into skills, so that you too can carry out research. Although concerned to convey the systematic application of appropriate professional standards, the module also tries to communicate some of the excitement and fun of doing research.

The module makes four main contributions to the degree program:

1.        It lays a foundation of knowledge and critical awareness about how research gets done, which helps to appreciate and make sense of the other sociological sources used in the rest of the degree’s modules.

2.        It enables the best choice of research methods to be made for doing your research for the Final Year Dissertation in sociology.

3.        More generally, the informed and critical thinking learned in the module can also be applied to analyse what really lies behind media news-stories, politicians’ speeches, lobby groups’ reports on social problems – and even gossip – that we all encounter as citizens.

4.        Finally, because Research Social Life I delivers a substantial part of “what every sociology graduate can be expected to know”, having studied the subject, it offers the opportunity to acquire transferable skills for later employment in a range of professions. These include interviewing, analysing social behaviour, using computers to process quantitative information, where to locate data on public issues and how to apply them, and how to make sense of social surveys.",,,,,,"- The lectures provide the main framework and content with respect to the foundations and building blocks of sociological research and how these relate to social knowledge. 
- The computer labs and seminars allow students to practise the discipline’s main empirical and methodological approaches, in order to achieve the learning outcomes through discussion, practical exercises and both formative and summative assessment.
- The drop-in Q&A sessions allow students to clarify the lecture contents and the assessment
- Online data management and software workshops allow student to enhance their knowledge and skills by completing online tutorials provided freely by external parties
- Assigned textbook and research application readings (journal articles) help students to gain a deeper understanding of the methods covered and provide real-life examples of their application in recent published research","The importance of sociological skills and practice is recognised by assessing students’ capacities to put their newly acquired skills into action by performing set tasks. The topics for all the assessments are introduced and demonstrated in lectures, then practiced in computer labs and seminars, before students do an individual piece of assessment inter alia to discover how far they have achieved the learning outcomes and the relevant items in the graduate skills framework.

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Researching Social Life II,20,Dr Miranda Iossifidis,"This module is about ‘research design’ – or how to do a research project and prepares students for their dissertations. It allows students to consider what kind of sociologist they want to be. It enables students to understand how sociologists take a topic and develop it into a research question in a form that can be answered using empirical evidence. This involves exploring the range of practical methods of collecting and analyzing social data which researchers deploy, through examples of research studies, workshops and independent exercises, and each student’s personal choice of a dissertation research question for Stage Three. This process also enhances and consolidates the students’ various social research skills previously gained in SOC2069 by focusing on a small number of specific research questions.

The aims of the module are to:
•        Develop understanding of the key methodological debates in sociological research;
•        Engage students in the critical and analytical study of research strategies;
•        Develop understanding of the ethical, political and practical challenges that may be encountered in social research, and how these are mediated by the contexts in which research takes place;
•        Enable the critical evaluation of research findings.
•        Develop critical reflection skills in relation to practical social research methods experience. 
•        Develop transferable skills, including skills and knowledge of research methods that will be relevant to many spheres beyond academia.",,,,,,"The lectures will provide the key underpinnings of the module. These will be supported by workshops and small group teaching. Workshops will be skills focused and provide students exposure to current research ongoing in the subject area, with a focus on learning from hearing about these experiences as well as undertaking some of their own experiments in the workshop and independent study. There will also be two workshops to support students with their assessments. Finally small group teaching will allow students to interact with each other and be supported by teaching staff to explore the core aspects of research design and current methodological debates through key texts. 

In the latter part of the semester students will be assigned a proposal supervisor to support them develop their research ideas and put together a dissertation proposal.","The critical methodological appraisal assesses the competence of students to successfully analyse research designs from a methodological standpoint and identify and discuss the ethical, practical and political dimensions of sociological research. It  also draws on students’ own methodological experience from in-class workshops or from SOC2069 to enable students’ critical reflection on their role as a researcher.

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Dreamworlds: Society and the utopian imagination (Inactive),20,Dr Lisa Garforth,"In the early years of the 21st century we have witnessed dramatic renewals, reversals and rewritings of hopes and fears about the future. Predictions of coming catastrophe – economic meltdown, political chaos, climate crisis – circulate intensively in media and popular debate. Dystopian narratives and anti-utopian thinking are deeply sutured into our culture. But we have also seen powerful demands for a better world. From the revival of political populism to Black Lives Matter; from proposals for a green new deal to the performative activism of Extinction Rebellion; from fiction by Ursula Le Guin to the Afrofuturist visions of Janelle Monae - desires for better futures play out across politics, culture, the arts and everyday life. Utopian thought is entangled with contemporary debates on climate change, the future of work, social justice, meritocracy, sexual identities – the list goes on.  Even in the pandemic we have seen some hope for a more equal and caring society and practices of mutual aid and solidarity emerge alongside pain, disruption, inequality and fear. 

This module looks at how human cultures are suffused with attempts to imagine and practice better ways of living. Utopianism is both more ubiquitous and more socially and sociologically important than you might think. The module explores how utopias are shaped by the political, intellectual and social dynamics of their times, but also how utopias might reshape ideas, people and communities. Utopianism is indispensable to thinking critically and creatively about both the way societies are and the way they should be. As such we might wonder why it doesn’t play a more prominent role in sociology. On this module you will engage intensively with questions of what utopias are, where we might find them, and what they do in and to our worlds. The module offers theoretical resources for conceptualising utopia and exploring utopianism as a mode of social analysis, as well as opportunities to examine and analyse wide-ranging examples of utopian thought and practice. The module will:

-        introduce examples of utopian thought, texts and practices and situate them in their social contexts;
-        consider debates about the definition, nature and function of utopian ideas in modern and postmodern societies;
-        explore the links between utopianism, society and social change.",,,,,,"The lectures will deliver crucial introductions to and overviews of central module topics and debates.

University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology","Memory, identity and nation-building in eastern Europe: The view from anthropology",20,Dr Anselma Gallinat,"The states in eastern Europe have faced fundamental changes with the fall of socialism.  These changes were political and economic but affected, in unprecedented ways on people's everyday lives: changing notions of the person, senses of identity, values, experiences of time. They continue to cause considerable reflection on memory, history and the identity of the nation. Almost forty years after the ‘fall of socialism’ these processes allow us insights into the very dynamics of social and cultural change – as well as insights into what it means to be eastern European and, in reflection, western European, if those categories really do exist. The module seeks to explore the experience of this monumental transformation and of ways of life in ‘postsocialism’ anthropologically by focusing on aspects of social structure, culture, identity, personhood, and nation-building and memory. Simultaneously, the module casts a critical eye on developments in the discipline itself that arose from the fall of socialism, the meeting of academics from 'East' and 'West', and asks whether the notion of postsocialism still makes sense forty years on.

The main objectives are: 

To develop students' knowledge and awareness of current anthropology through an exploration of the literature that focuses on eastern Europe.
To develop students' understanding of the study of rapid social and cultural change.
To explore, through case studies, anthropological concepts of memory, history, nation-building and identity in particular.
To develop students' abilities in reading ethnographic texts critically, to apply knowledge from different sources to inform their reading, and to develop skills to argue logically and analytically, both orally and in writing.""",,,,,,"The module is structured in three parts. The first two lectures and first seminar introduce students to the study of the postsocialist transformation in eastern-central Europe. The following four lectures, three seminars and one film explore particular aspects of this change through examples from a range of countries.

The third part of the module is the longest and in four lectures, two seminars and two films  it explores questions of nation-building, memory and identity. The seminars again serve to practice the critical reading of ethnographic texts and critical viewing of films through discussion; they help clarify concepts in discussion, and practice analytical skills with regard to different materials especially in seminar seven. Student presentations during one seminar in preparation of assignment one will be used to ensure that learning outcomes are met as well as to consolidate learning and skills outcomes.

The number of hours exceeds to 2022-23 GPS model. This is due to the film showings (6hrs) which include two feature films and one documentary. These films are useful for illustration but cannot replace lecture content. The time needed is not exactly 6 hrs as one film is only around 1 hour in length, but this showing is at times followed by discussion - this is to say that the allocated 6 hrs are sued flexibly depending on student need.","The book review asks students to critically review an ethnography and to situate it within the context of a field of wider literature. This assignment tests and enhances critical and analytical reading skills as well as literacy (synthesis of texts), it requires students to become acquainted with one case-example and thus one country in depth, practicing cultural and global awareness. 

The essay allows for in-depth exploration of themes covered by the module thus testing learning outcomes with regard to both knowledge and skills.

Both assignments are preceded by formative assessment plans which are optional for students.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/gps/,
University of Newcastle,NU,"Geography, Politics and Sociology",Investigating the Body,20,Professor Janice McLaughlin,"The module will introduce students to, and advance their knowledge of, social and ethical debates around the human body. It will explore important theoretical understandings of how we live in our bodies, how our body plays a part in social interaction, is transformed, ages, is treated by medicine, and is regulated by law and social norms. In doing so we will explore the significance of the human body to our position in the world.

The topics in the module have been selected to capture contemporary dynamics around the human body which raise questions about social acceptability and legal regulation in different spheres of intimate and social life. They also will allow us to consider how we can research the human body and its significance to interaction and identity. Sociological theory on the body and embodiment is at the heart of the module.

Alongside this, the module also aims to introduce students to ethical challenges around what it is possible for individuals or institutions such as medicine to do to the body and how that should be regulated by law, policy frameworks and professional codes of practice. Research being undertaken by the module leader on different aspects of contemporary investigations of the body will be drawn upon to give students rich and distinctive insight into how to scrutinise the social and ethical shaping of the body. The module will also integrate the COVID-19 pandemic into what we explore given to how the crisis has changed numerous aspects of the management of the individual body, as well as the social body.

The module aims are:

To explore how the shape, appearance and capabilities of people’s bodies has an influence on their social position and identity.

To introduce students to important sociological understandings about the body and embodiment from across medical sociology, disability studies, sociology of the body and others.

To develop students' knowledge of important social, legal and political processes of regulating the body and creative practices of transforming the body.

To introduce students to some of the ethical debates about how far the body should be regulated and how much the body can be transformed.

The module will draw from primarily contemporary areas of sociological debate and every day practice where bodies matter in order to explore the body’s social significance. Of particular importance are concerns in medical sociology and disability studies about how medicine treats bodies which are different because of their varied capacities, either because of lifelong disability or because of the emergence of limitations in what the body can do due to ageing, illness or injury. It will also look at sociological engagement with the productive aspects of body expression, by incorporating debates about how we can ‘enhance’ our body’s capacity by doing things such as taking drugs to make our bodies thinner, stronger or faster, or creatively changing our bodies via cosmetic surgery, piercing or tattoos as a vehicle for representing a different or changing aspect of our identities.",,,,,,"Workshops provide an opportunity for the students to undertake a variety of tasks and interactions with the module leader that deepen their understanding of key concepts within the module.

The small group teaching - which will take the form of seminars - provides opportunities for the students to work together in smaller collectives to engage with how we can evaluate the social and ethical dimensions of what bodies can and cannot do and how they can be changed.","In the essay the students will be given several essay questions to choose from, each of which will ask them to critically evaluate theoretical ideas within the sociology of the body. The work they will do to complete the essay and the feedback they will receive will help enhance their critical writing skills. The final assessment emphasises their independent learning skills by applying the ideas they have been introduced to evaluate the social and ethical significance of a particular issue.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/gps/,

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Introduction to Archaeological Science,20,Dr Andrea Dolfini,"Archaeological Science (AS) is the application of scientific methods to the study of the human past. In the last few decades, archaeologists have deployed a wide range of scientific methods to research problems including human evolution, chronology, climate, the environment, health, diet, technology, mobility, the manufacture and exchange of goods, and many, many more. The module introduces some of the main problems that archaeologists address using scientific methods of enquiry, as well as the methods themselves. It also shows how scientific and non-scientific methods of enquiry can work together to enhance our understanding of the past. Case studies ranging from prehistory to historical times, small group lab practicals, and tutorials will help you familiarise with this fast-growing branch of archaeology. Given its introductory nature, the module does not require any scientific background knowledge.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Archaeological Theory and Interpretation,20,Dr Chris Fowler,"The last sixty years have seen some radical changes in how we study the past. The majority of these stem from the recognition that the past must be actively interpreted in the present. During this module we will explore the major trends in archaeological theory over the last sixty years and consider how each of these assists in the interpretation of the past. Such theoretical trends have not only shaped archaeology but also played an integral role in many other disciplines, including anthropology, history of all kinds, geography, philosophy, sociology and cultural theory. For that reason, topics covered in this module are of wider relevance as they provide a guide to the ideas characteristic of the modern and postmodern world in which we live. Nonetheless, while the course is designed to address theoretical perspectives on the past, emphasis will be given to the practical deployment of theoretical perspectives in interpreting the past.

This module aims to develop an awareness of the relationship between archaeological interpretation and theoretical reasoning, to provide a detailed understanding of developments in archaeological theory over the last four decades, and to illustrate the impact of different theoretical approaches on our understanding of the past and on present social, cultural and political contexts.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",The Archaeology of Byzantium and its Neighbours,20,Dr Mark Jackson,"The early medieval period saw a radical realignment in the economic, social and political structures of Europe, the Mediterranean and western Asia which remain fundamental for understanding many of the tensions in the modern world. Byzantium was a unique state located between the new, dynamic Islamic world and the early medieval kingdoms of continental Europe. The course examines the material culture and structures of Byzantium and its neighbours from the beginning of Justinian’s reign in the 6th century to AD 850. The study will begin by considering Justinian’s empire and in particular by reviewing the recent debate on the end of urbanism in late antiquity. We will consider the debates which have been put forward for the end of Antiquity in both the east and the west but we will focus on urbanism in the Eastern provinces. We will look at the rise of Islam and consider the impact the Arab invasions had on the Byzantine world as well as on religion and transport in the eastern Mediterranean. Orthodox Christianity was crucial for the survival of the Byzantine state and the crisis concerning the worship of religious images known as Iconoclasm, raises issues relevant for understanding the significance of images and belief in the medieval and the modern worlds. Other themes include methodological problems in the use of historical and archaeological sources and the contested nature of many medieval buildings in the recent past because of their significance for different people today.

The aim of this module is to understand the transformation of the Classical world and the emergence of new and diverse material cultures, institutions and ideologies in the Byzantine Empire and its neighbours, including the Islamic world as well as to consider how these buildings and places continue to be places of significance and contention in contemporary society.",,,,,,"Lectures will provide a historical overview and introduce major written sources, material culture and monuments of Byzantine and Islamic art and archaeology. Lectures will also present subject-specific information relating especially to the ways in which sources can be interpreted and will highlight critically ways that sources have been misinterpreted in the past. Lecture materials will direct students to reading to explore ideas and concepts further. Workshops will build students' research and communication skills as well as their personal confidence and will prepare students for written assessments. Structured guided research, assessments and reading together with independent learning will be needed by students to embed and to build on information from lectures. This independent work will enable students to become familiar with the wide range of visual and structural evidence and its critical interpretation.

Workshops give students the opportunity for independent study and for team working. All students should prepare by reading in advance of all workshops. Each student will be expected to jointly lead a workshop by giving a group presentation as a recorded video during the semester for their formative assessment. Other students will give feedback on others' presentations so students must ensure they have uploaded the video by the Friday in advance of the class. These formative presentations will enable all students to reflect on the content and skills that make effective presentations. Research for the presentations will enable students to investigate their topics in good time for the essay submission. 

Summative Essay
Each student will develop a research question with the module leader for a 1500-word essay on the theme of their presentation for a workshop. The essay tests knowledge outcomes and develops skills in research, reading and writing. This piece of work should be aimed at to a specialist and up-to-date academic-research audience. 

Creative Project

Who built megalithic temples on Malta and astounding palaces and sanctuaries on Crete? Who were the Mycenaeans? What triggered the transition from egalitarian to ranked societies? How did the earliest Etruscan and Greek cities arose, and why? The module will address these questions (among others) and explore the socio-political trajectories taken by Mediterranean communities and polities from the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition to the Iron Age, c.10,000 to 500 BC. As part of this fascinating armchair journey, we will explore as diverse themes as the spread of the Neolithic way of life; the emergence of social complexity in Copper Age Iberia; the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces at the end of the Bronze Age; and the emergence of urban societies in Iron Age Greece and Italy. The module is a blend of online and present-in-person activities including thematic lectures, seminars, reading, class presentations by students, videos, and revision quizzes. The lectures present overviews of cultural frameworks and social developments; the seminars provide students with the opportunity to discuss current problems in later Mediterranean prehistory; and the online resources offer meaningful opportunities to test knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.

It covers a selection of methods employed by zooarchaeologists in their efforts to reconstruct the past relationships formed between people and animals. These include the reconstruction of subsistence strategies, animal-husbandry practices, trade networks and socio-cultural dynamics. Faunal remains can also identify how people interacted daily with non-human animals and their local environments. Through a series of hands-on activities, the course teaches students how to identify animal bones commonly recovered from British archaeological sites and how to apply an appropriate range of basic zooarchaeological methods typically used to address the core research goals of the discipline.

Aims:
-To familiarise students to the advanced methods employed in the identification and analysis of animal bones recovered from archaeological sites. 
-For students to critically engage with the goals of zooarchaeological research and how archaeologists use faunal data to reconstruct past human diets and human-animal relationships. 
-To understand how faunal remains are transformed by taphonomic processes.
-To understand the quantification methods related to the analysis of animal bones
-To familiarize students with the process of collecting faunal data and writing faunal reports.",,,,,,"Three-hour single-session in-class meetings include both lecture and practical components.  Students are introduced to new methods or techniques relating to the identification/analysis of animal bones and are then immediately provided with practical exercises that allow them to put the newly learned information into practice.

Formative lab assignments and quizzes are given throughout the term in order to encourage students to progressively gather the skills and data necessary to complete the final report. The report requires students to identify and analyse an archaeological faunal assemblage using the appropriate zooarchaeological methods that were introduced to them over the course of the module. Successful completion of the report will demonstrate the student’s understanding of the goals and methods of zooarchaeology and enhance their research skills through the production, analysis and synthesis of original data. The identifications made to produce the report, will provide students with additional practice and experience needed for the identification skills quiz.

A formative assessment will provide early feedback on your identification skills prior to submission of identifications as part of the report. 

A 2000-word essay will give students the opportunity to further explore one of the broader research topics introduced in class while making explicit use of zooarchaeological data drawn from critically-examined case studies. Successful essays will demonstrate the student’s understanding of zooarchaeology as a tool to investigate past economic and/or social behaviours while improving their research, information retrieval and information technology skills.

Greek literature has supplied themes and personalities which have inspired artists of all kinds throughout the history of Western culture.  Combining detailed analysis of individual works with the study of overall themes and issues, this module aims to explore the impact Greek literature has had on Western literature, music and art.  Central texts include Plutarch's Lives & Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, works inspired by Sophocles' *Antigone*.  Themes studied include questions of transformation and adaptation - crossing genres, crossing cultures - and questions of classical subjects harnessed to modern causes and ideas.  Aspects of Dr. Phillippo’s own research  - some of it in progress - feed into the module.  The principal texts will be supplemented by material from other genres and media: poetry, opera and the visual arts.  All non-English works to be studied in translation.

This module aims:
•To promote understanding of and insight into questions of cross-cultural inspiration and adaptation raised by the 'reception' of Greek literature in the Western cultural tradition.
•To develop skills in critical analysis, applied to the relationship between a work of literature and its literary source;
•To develop flexibility in applying skills of literary analysis in different contexts, extending these particularly to texts and other artistic works from outwith the classical world.",,,,,,"Lectures are designed to:

- introduce students to the overall approaches and techniques involved in studying the Classical tradition;
- introduce students to the background of the various texts (etc.) studied and to illustrate the application to details of the texts of overall issues both regarding the texts themselves and regarding the themes of the module
- provide guidance on preparing for the assessments.

Recorded 'lecture materials' as part of structured guided learning are designed to supplement the in-person lectures, providing for example: further examples demonstrating the ideas and approaches on the texts (etc.) introduced in the lectures; illustrations and explanation for independent learning activities and lecture preparation set in relation to lecture content.  

Groupwork and discussion within lectures, workshops and small group sessions, as well as structured guided learning, research and reading activities, are designed to:

- give students the chance to enhance their understanding of the ideas and approaches presented, by applying these for themselves to illustrative excerpts of texts (etc.);

- develop students' skills of interpersonal communication

Small group sessions and some workshops are designed to give students the opportunity to apply in depth, with advance preparation, the ideas and approaches encountered in lectures, to aspects of the central set texts studied; to lay the foundation for material which they may include in the submitted assignment; and to develop their skills of oral and interpersonal communication.

The Drop-in/surgery hour allows students to seek further clarification on aspects of the assessment tasks.","The take-home examination requires students to correlate and compare detailed material from pairs of comparative texts (or other creative works influenced by specific texts and aspects of the classical world).  The open book format tests the students' skills of working within a restricted time-frame to a specific tight brief, while allowing students to consult the range of primary material necessary for a strong detailed analysis. 

Assignment:
The assignment tests students' ability to apply skills (of literary and visual analysis) and concepts learned in the first half of the module, and skills of initiative and communication.

While the two 2,500-word limits for the summative assessment components are slightly over the normal limits, the total word limit for all assessments — 5,000 — is still within the overall maximum of 6,000 words set out in the University Assessment Tariff guidelines (section 11, footnote).  The reason for these limits is the same as those for which an assessment tariff exemption has been requested and granted in the past (most recently 2016): i.e. that in a comparative module of this kind each point requires students to cover material from two texts, so every point takes more words to make.

Students will be taught how to read and interpret literary texts that deal with dining and sympotic culture and will also learn how to analyse technical treatises such as medical works and ancient cookbooks (including those preserved on papyrus). By teaching students about the function of ‘dining’ and symposia in literary works from across the ancient world, we also aim to introduce them to food and food production in a practical sense; thus, this course, whilst primarily centred on literary works and technical treatises, will be truly interdisciplinary, encouraging students to think about how literature and archaeology etc. connect (with food and dining serving as the vehicles for that study). Furthermore, special emphasis will be placed on rituals of commensality, which will provide a comparative element with contemporary society, since every society has rituals of commensality and laws governing the consumption of food and drink. We aim, therefore, to show students how the critical observation of antiquity’s laws and rituals can enable them to become more critical observers of their own culture.",,,,,,"Lectures (and non-synchronous lecture materials) impart core knowledge and an outline of knowledge that students are expected to acquire;  they stimulate development of listening and note-taking skills.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Human Dissection in Antiquity (stage 2),20,Dr Thomas Rütten,"Ancient medicine is one of the most important and influential achievements of classical civilization. The practice of human dissection is at the core of ancient medicine’s legacy to the modern world. It constitutes a cultural practice, in which medicine, science, religion, philosophy, law, and politics converge. Its history mirrors the history of Greek and Roman medicine on a micro level. 

We will be looking at early Greek speculations about the human body (pre-Socratic natural philosophers), at the growth of anatomical knowledge through chance observation (Hippocratic authors) and zootomy (Aristotle), at the rise of human anatomy in Hellenistic Alexandria (Herophilos, Erasistratos), the fall of human anatomy thereafter, its critics (Roman doctors and church fathers) and propagators (author of the pseudonymous Hippocratic letters), as well as its most devoted spokesman Galen of Pergamon who wasn’t able, however, to revive the practice of human dissection. We will also be looking at the rebirth of ancient anatomy and human dissection in Renaissance Italy, especially in the work of Vesalius.

The module enables students to study an aspect of (ancient) culture from a variety of angles: history of science, medicine, religion, philosophy (natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and epistemology), law, and society.

The course further aims to:

1. Provide students with a sound knowledge of the origins and development of Greek and Roman anatomy and the numerous ways, in which it is embedded in ancient societies and cultures
2. Provide insight into the ways the Greeks and Romans dealt with death, dead bodies, and cultural taboos surrounding them
3. Develop the students’ skills of analysis, interpretation and evaluation of texts and secondary sources, and further develop their skills of written and oral communication, particularly in seminars.
4. Develop the students’ capacity for independent study in independent student study groups and enhance their team spirit.
5. Confront students with their own bodies, mortality, ideas about dying and death, and personal sense of decency vis-a-vis the dead body",,,,,,"Lectures, both PIP and online, are used:
•        to introduce the types, characteristics and distribution of evidence for or against the ancient practice of human dissection
•        to introduce the methods by which this evidence can be most effectively used in gaining knowledge about ancient anatomy
•        to draw attention to key aspects of this evidence for further, independent study
•        to discuss the interpretation of the evidence, and the problems involved in its interpretation
•        to recommend secondary readings relevant to the interpretive problems raised, and highlight essential arguments and controversies in these readings
•        to challenge students to consider both the preconceptions they may have about the dead human body, and how these preconceptions may shape their interpretation of ancient anatomical practices and their epistemological, ethical, religious, legal, cultural, and scientific contexts. 
•        to provide focussed instruction and practice in developing specific research skills assessed in the module (e.g. constructing a bibliography for an essay, structuring an essay, constructing an argument, referencing it and composing a narrative)
Seminars are used:
•        to allow students to discuss a prescribed piece of secondary literature in a small group, in a conversation structured by seminar questions distributed in advance
•        to give students the opportunity to articulate their own arguments about an aspect of human dissection in ancient times
•        to provide a supportive and constructive environment for developing, sharing and evaluating ideas that could form the basis for the coursework essay

How do you try to influence their behaviour and policies? How do you come across as a nice, trustworthy and/or knowledgeable person? And how can you whip up an audience’s emotions?

The power of oratory, again recognised today, was well known to the Greeks and Romans, and in this module we will study some of the many speeches from antiquity that illustrate it. The emphasis is on the court speeches of Cicero – perhaps the greatest orator of antiquity –, but we will also look, e.g., at Greek speeches made in court (Lysias) and in the assembly (Demosthenes). We will also look at rhetorical theory, to see whether it offers answers to the above questions.
Finally, we will study two or three modern speeches, illustrating that the techniques used for studying ancient oratory can also be employed in understanding its modern counterpart. These may include Abraham Lincoln’s ‘Gettysburg Address’ and Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’.

The aims of this module are:
1. To provide students with an understanding of classical and especially Ciceronian rhetoric, including its political, social and intellectual background.
2. To provide students with an understanding of the relevance of (classical) rhetoric as well as its limitations for studying other ancient genres and for studying modern speeches and texts.
3. To enhance students' skills at analysing ancient texts in translation.",,,,,,"Lectures will have a strong interactive component, which is the rationale for making all hours PiP. This is important in a subject that relies heavily on constant student engagement with rhetorical texts, which are completely interwoven with their historical and theoretical background. During the covid period we have had ample experience with non-iP teaching, and we know that students simply do not engage as well with that.
The lectures are used:
1. to introduce the (historical, intellectual) context of the prescribed texts
2. to show in practice how to analyse passages from a speech and a speech as a whole
3. to discuss students' reading and understanding of the prescribed texts and of the relationships between rhetorical theory and practice
4. to make explicit historical and other relationships between the texts read
5. to discuss the students' reading and understanding of the prescribed secondary literature, and the methods available to check and evaluate these secondary sources against the primary ones

The seminars are used for giving students the opportunity for in-depth engagement with, and discussion about, central rhetorical problems (from the interpretation of the use of character in speeches to the issue of the morality of rhetorical manipulation).

Independent study is supposed to be used:
1. to read and analyse the prescribed (primary and secondary) literature
2. to complete the assessed assignments","Examination is important: while it also tests the skills outcomes, it particularly tests the knowledge outcomes. An exam is the best way of testing all of the latter, and the only feasible way of testing the first: it is vital that students make sure that they have a command of the facts of the court cases involved and of the overall lines of approach taken in the speeches, without being able to rely on time-consuming use of reference tools.

The Homeric epics derive from a long oral tradition, and while they stand at the very beginning of western literature, they are complex and multi-faceted works which have been interpreted in many different ways. This module will examine the Odyssey in the context of the early Greek epic tradition surrounding the Trojan War legend, and, more specifically, will explore its relationship with the other great Homeric epic, the Iliad, studying the parallels and contrasts between portrayals of heroes and heroism, narrative technique, characterization and emotion, and thematic design.  

The module aims to train students to use details of a text for analysis and appreciation of:
•Stylistic and narrative design and effects
•Thematic patterns
•The handling of emotional impact
•The handling of character portrayal and of audience sympathies

The module aims to teach students to:
•Identify characteristic features of Homeric narrative technique, including those which reflect the Odyssey’s and the Iliad’s status as works designed for oral performance.
•Explore how these may work for an audience in a performance context, especially in terms of emotional and dramatic effect.",,,,,,"Lectures (which also mostly include group work on applying lecture themes to specific passages) are designed to introduce students to overall approaches to the text, its techniques and its cultural background, and to illustrate to students how these ideas may be applied to the exploration of textual detail (and vice versa), giving students the opportunity to try this latter approach also for themselves. 

Workshops give the students the opportunity to apply close reading techniques to excerpts from the texts. 

Seminars are designed to give students the opportunity to engage with issues about and approaches to the text for themselves, both in preparing an oral presentation and in preparing to participate in discussion; and also to develop students' skills of oral and interpersonal communication.","The examination will comprise a mixture of commentary and essay questions.
Commentary questions assess students’ capacity to analyse passages in detail, usually as a basis for discussing characteristic features of the text as a whole. Essay questions assess students’ ability to assemble their knowledge of the text(s) studied into a coherent discussion of key overall questions about the text.

The assignment tests skills in analysing and interpreting narrative techniques within the texts, applying for themselves skills practised in lectures and workshop sessions.

(1) Provide an understanding of the political and literary context of Neronian literature;
(2) Provide an understanding of the key interpretative problems raised in these texts;
(3) Provide an understanding of Neronian writers’ aims;
(4) Develop students' skills of textual interpretation, analysis and problem-solving as applied to Neronian Literature.
(5) Develop students' skills of interpersonal and written communication
(6) Encourage students to think about how to disseminate this information to a wider audience - this will allow them to reflect back upon the central themes within these texts.",,,,,,"Lectures introduce the texts and the period
Lecture materials provide additional content that cannot be covered in lectures. They help to support independent research as well as reinforcing the in-class content. Students can work with this material according to their own pace and schedule and there are opportunities to ask questions about it and to post comments on Canvas.
Seminars (PiP) - small group work focused on the texts
Workshops (PiP) - interactive session to revisit and revaluate the course content and prepare for assessment
Online training workshops - sessions tailored toward creating the portfolio projects. How to source and use content, how to work with different media.","The formative assessment will help students to prepare for the first written exercise, but it will also lay the groundwork for the portfolio project at the end of the course.

The commentary assessment gives students the opportunity to work in depth with a text so that they can the skills needs to incorporate texts into bigger projects (i.e. for assessment 2)

The portfolio project will be an opportunity for students to design their own project that focuses on using literature on Nero or from the Neronian period to present their own 'Neronian story'. This could be (for example) a (virtual) exhibition space, or it could be a journal/newspaper style article, or a podcast or an audio tour or some other form of media (must be discussed in advance with the module leader who will confirm the viability of the proposed project). The literature serves as a starting point for the story that the student wishes to tell. Regardless of the format chosen by the students for delivering their work, they must provide a written copy of their text with full references and bibliography. This serves as a control mechanism with respect to word count and ensuring that students can demonstrate that they have met the learning outcomes, while still given them creative freedom. Guidelines on how the assessment will be marked (in line with existing marking criteria) will be provided. This assessment allows students to look in depth at Neronian literature and how it connects to the Neronian age and cultural context. This is an opportunity for students to explore how texts fit within their context and to explore in greater detail the relationship between literature and the world that produces it.

All Erasmus students at Newcastle University are expected to do the same assessment as students registered for a degree.

Study-abroad, non-Erasmus exchange and Loyola students spending semester 1 only are required to finish their assessment while in Newcastle. This will take the form of an alternative assessment, as outlined in the formats below:

Modules assessed by Coursework and Exam:
The normal alternative form of assessment for all semester 1 non-EU study abroad students will be one essay in addition to the other coursework assessment (the length of the essay should be adjusted in order to comply with the assessment tariff); to be submitted no later than 12pm Friday of week 12. The essays should be set so as to assure coverage of the course content to date. 

Modules assessed by Exam only:

The primary focus will be on myths preserved in literature, but we will also look at visual representations related to the stories we will be examining. In our discussions we will incorporate modern theoretical approaches to the study of myth, and we will also consider Greek myth in its Near Eastern and Indo-European context.",,,,,,"Lectures impart core knowledge and an outline of knowledge that students are expected to acquire and they stimulate development of listening and note-taking skills.

Specifically, a basic lecture format is the most efficient method of expounding this material, which is both quite considerable and (often) quite difficult and/or alien to modern perspectives and sensibilities. All lectures allow time for questions and (some) discussion.

Seminars provide students with an opportunity to participate in discussion and thus to improve their oral communication skills. Seminar topics will be keyed to the first assessment component (Research Project).

The drop-in session at the end of the semester will give students an additional opportunity to ask questions on the material discussed throughout the module as they prepare towards the final assessment.

All sessions will be held in-person, unless covid-related guidance prevents us from doing so. In that case, class meetings will be held as synchronous on-line sessions via zoom.","The exam tests: 
(i) the acquisition of a clear general knowledge of the subject that can be deployed without recourse to handbooks or other printed or on-line resources; 
(ii) the ability to think and analyse a problem quickly, to select from and to apply both the general knowledge and detailed knowledge of aspects of the subject to new questions;
(iii) students' problem-solving skills, adaptability, and the ability to work unaided and to write effectively and concisely.

In addition to the exam, there is one written assignment (research project) in this module. This assignment asks of students to identify and critically discuss early modern or contemporary allusions or references to Greek myth that they have encountered outside of the classroom; these can derive from different media (e.g., literary texts, films, music, visual arts, cartoons, advertisment etc.). Students are asked to find the ancient sources pertaining to the mythological reference they are examining, as well as relevant secondary literature to underpin their discussion of the ways in which the myth has been adapted and the effects generated by this adaptation.

The formative assessment is intended to hone students' skills in engaging with secondary literature and provide feedback ahead of the first component of the assessment (research project).

All Erasmus students at Newcastle University are expected to do the same assessment as students registered for a degree unless they have compelling reasons not to do so. If this is the case, they are offered the alternative of writing one 3,000 word essay to be handed in by 12.00 p.m. of the Friday of the first week of the assessment period. This will replace all assessment work required of other students on the module.

In order to take up this option, students need to discuss it with the Study Abroad Co-ordinator and their module leader, having checked with their home university that the new assessment will be accepted by them. The Study Abroad Co-ordinator will have the final say on such issues.

Study-abroad, non-Erasmus exchange and Loyola students spending semester 1 only are required to finish their assessment while in Newcastle.

How do we ‘see’ anything while we are asleep? Can dreams be trusted? Do they come from our soul? Our brain? The gods? 

Dreams and their interpretation posed as many questions in antiquity as they do today, and the dreams themselves took many forms: there was not simply the one standardised ‘ancient dream’. This module, then, examines the multitude of ways dreams and the dream experience appear across a wide variety of texts and sources from the ancient world and beyond, led by two key questions: where do dreams come from, and what – if anything – do they mean? 

All materials will be studied in translation; there is no expectation or requirement that students have any knowledge of Ancient Greek or Latin.",,,,,,"Lectures and lecture materials are used to introduce students to a wide range of authors and texts. The content will be supported by relevant contextual and historical information where necessary. They also introduce methods of interpretation and analysis, and draw attention to comparative models. Elements of group-work and student-teacher interaction will reinforce the delivered material. 

Seminars are used to facilitate student-led discussion on a particular text and pre-circulated questions in a small structured environment. It provides the opportunity for students to explore the material for themselves, drawing on weekly lectures, and to enter into a dialogue with each other on the multifaceted nature of meaning and interpretation.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",The Classical Inheritance in Western Culture,20,Dr Susanna Phillippo,"""An honourable man"", a rebel with a cause, human sacrifice and a dutiful daughter... Greek literature has supplied themes and personalities which have inspired artists of all kinds throughout the history of Western culture.  Combining detailed analysis of individual works with the study of overall themes and issues, this module aims to explore the impact Greek literature has had on Western literature, music and art.  Central texts include Plutarch's Lives & Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, works inspired by Sophocles' *Antigone*.  Themes studied include questions of transformation and adaptation - crossing genres, crossing cultures - and questions of classical subjects harnessed to modern causes and ideas.  Aspects of Dr. Phillippo’s own research  - some of it in progress - feed into the module.  The principal texts will be supplemented by material from other genres and media: poetry, opera and the visual arts.  All non-English works to be studied in translation.

This module aims:
•To promote understanding of and insight into questions of cross-cultural inspiration and adaptation raised by the 'reception' of Greek literature in the Western cultural tradition.
•To develop skills in critical analysis, applied to the relationship between a work of literature and its literary source;
•To develop flexibility in applying skills of literary analysis in different contexts, extending these particularly to texts and other artistic works from outwith the classical world.",,,,,,"Lectures are designed to:

- introduce students to the overall approaches and techniques involved in studying the Classical tradition;
- introduce students to the background of the various texts (etc.) studied and to illustrate the application to details of the texts of overall issues both regarding the texts themselves and regarding the themes of the module
- provide guidance on preparing for the assessments.

Recorded 'lecture materials' as part of structured guided learning are designed to supplement the in-person lectures, providing for example: further examples demonstrating the ideas and approaches on the texts (etc.) introduced in the lectures; illustrations and explanation for independent learning activities and lecture preparation set in relation to lecture content.  

Groupwork and discussion within lectures, workshops and small group sessions, as well as structured guided learning, research and reading activities, are designed to:

- give students the chance to enhance their understanding of the ideas and approaches presented, by applying these for themselves to illustrative excerpts of texts (etc.);

- develop students' skills of interpersonal communication

Small group sessions and some workshops are designed to give students the opportunity to apply in depth, with advance preparation, the ideas and approaches encountered in lectures, to aspects of the central set texts studied; to lay the foundation for material which they may include in the submitted assignment; and to develop their skills of oral and interpersonal communication.

The Drop-in/surgery hour allows students to seek further clarification on aspects of the assessment tasks.","The take-home examination requires students to correlate and compare detailed material from pairs of comparative texts (or other creative works influenced by specific texts and aspects of the classical world).  The open book format tests the students' skills of working within a restricted time-frame to a specific tight brief, while allowing students to consult the range of primary material necessary for a strong detailed analysis. 

Assignment:
The assignment tests students' ability to apply skills (of literary and visual analysis) and concepts learned in the first half of the module, and skills of initiative and communication.

While the two 2,500-word limits for the summative assessment components are slightly over the normal limits, the total word limit for all assessments — 5,000 — is still within the overall maximum of 6,000 words set out in the University Assessment Tariff guidelines (section 11, footnote).  The reason for these limits is the same as those for which an assessment tariff exemption has been requested and granted in the past (most recently 2016): i.e. that in a comparative module of this kind each point requires students to cover material from two texts, so every point takes more words to make.

By teaching students about the function of ‘dining’ and symposia in literary works from across the ancient world, we also aim to introduce them to food and food production in a practical sense; thus, this course, whilst primarily centred on literary works and technical treatises, will be truly interdisciplinary, encouraging students to think about how literature and archaeology etc. connect (with food and dining serving as the vehicles for that study). Furthermore, special emphasis will be placed on rituals of commensality, which will provide a comparative element with contemporary society, since every society has rituals of commensality and laws governing the consumption of food and drink.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Human Dissection in Antiquity (stage 3),20,Dr Thomas Rütten,"Ancient medicine is one of the most important and influential achievements of classical civilization. The practice of human dissection is at the core of ancient medicine’s legacy to the modern world. It constitutes a cultural practice, in which medicine, science, religion, philosophy, law, and politics converge. Its history mirrors the history of Greek and Roman medicine on a micro level. 

We will be looking at early Greek speculations about the human body (pre-Socratic natural philosophers), at the growth of anatomical knowledge through chance observation (Hippocratic authors) and zootomy (Aristotle), at the rise of human anatomy in Hellenistic Alexandria (Herophilos, Erasistratos), the fall of human anatomy thereafter, its critics (Roman doctors and church fathers) and propagators (author of the pseudonymous Hippocratic letters), as well as its most devoted spokesman Galen of Pergamon who wasn’t able, however, to revive the practice of human dissection. We will also be looking at the rebirth of ancient anatomy and human dissection in Renaissance Italy, especially in the work of Vesalius.

The module aims to enable students to study an aspect of (ancient) culture from a variety of angles: history of science, medicine, religion, philosophy (natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and epistemology), law, and society.

The course further aims to:
1. Provide students with a sound knowledge of the origins and development of Greek and Roman anatomy and the numerous ways in which it is embedded in ancient societies and cultures.
2. Provide insight into the ways the Greeks and Romans dealt with death, dead bodies, and cultural taboos surrounding them.
3. Develop the students’ skills of analysis, interpretation and evaluation of texts and secondary sources, and further develop their skills of written and oral communication, particularly in seminars.
4. Develop the students’ capacity for independent study in independent student study groups and enhance their team spirit.
5. Confront students with their own bodies, mortality, ideas about dying and death, and personal sense of decency vis-a-vis the dead body.",,,,,,"Lectures, both PIP and online, are used:
•        to introduce the types, characteristics and distribution of evidence for or against the ancient practice of human dissection
•        to introduce the methods by which this evidence can be most effectively used in gaining knowledge about ancient anatomy
•        to draw attention to key aspects of this evidence for further, independent study
•        to discuss the interpretation of the evidence, and the problems involved in its interpretation
•        to recommend secondary readings relevant to the interpretive problems raised, and highlight essential arguments and controversies in these readings
•        to challenge students to consider both the preconceptions they may have about the dead human body, and how these preconceptions may shape their interpretation of ancient anatomical practices and their epistemological, ethical, religious, legal, cultural, and scientific contexts. 
•        to provide focussed instruction and practice in developing specific research skills assessed in the module (e.g. constructing a bibliography for an essay, structuring an essay, constructing an argument, referencing it and composing a narrative)
Seminars are used:
•        to allow students to discuss a prescribed piece of secondary literature in a small group, in a conversation structured by seminar questions distributed in advance
•        to give students the opportunity to articulate their own arguments about an aspect of human dissection in ancient times
•        to provide a supportive and constructive environment for developing, sharing and evaluating ideas that could form the basis for the coursework essay.

Workshops are used to help students switch from the receptive to a productive mode of learning. They will provide an opportunity for group work on specific tasks preparing them for their assignments. They will test their ability to apply the skills acquired in lectures and seminars to specific essay-related tasks. Finally, they will serve to discuss anonymized coursework of previous cohorts and thus turn students into markers","The documentary commentary tests the students’ ability to isolate and analyse the relevant features of source texts. It encourages the close reading of a short text of primary material (in translation), and presents an opportunity for applying analytical and interpretative skills, methodological sophistication and sensible contextualisation. It also invites students to engage with key concepts, key texts, key events and key players in ancient history of human dissection mentioned in the extracts and to explain to a non-expert 21st century audience how to make sense of the piece of primary evidence they have chosen from the range of options.
The essay tests intended knowledge and skills outcomes, develops key skills in research, reading and writing. It provides an opportunity to the students to pursue their own research project within the module's overall theme. They will use the lectures and seminars as well as the workshops as a foundation and the module's reading list as a guide to develop their own pathway of investigation and critical analysis. An essay with its exposure to a focussed topic over a sustained period of time is a much better way to apply acquired skills in an assignment than, say, an exam.

How do you try to influence their behaviour and policies? How do you come across as a nice, trustworthy and/or knowledgeable person? And how can you whip up an audience’s emotions?

The power of oratory, again recognised today, was well known to the Greeks and Romans, and in this module we will study some of the many speeches from antiquity that illustrate it. The emphasis is on the court speeches of Cicero – perhaps the greatest orator of antiquity – but we will also look, e.g., at Greek speeches made in court (Lysias) and in the assembly (Demosthenes). We will also look at rhetorical theory, to see whether it offers answers to the above questions.
Finally, we will study two or three modern speeches, illustrating that the techniques used for studying ancient oratory can also be employed in understanding its modern counterpart. These may include Abraham Lincoln’s ‘Gettysburg Address’ and Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have a Dream’.

The aims of this module are:
1. To provide students with an understanding of classical and especially Ciceronian rhetoric, including its political, social and intellectual background.
2. To provide students with an understanding of the relevance of (classical) rhetoric as well as its limitations for studying other ancient genres and for studying modern speeches and texts.
3. To enhance students' skills at analysing ancient texts in translation.",,,,,,"Lectures will have a strong interactive component, which is the rationale for making all hours PiP. This is important in a subject that relies heavily on constant student engagement with rhetorical texts, which are completely interwoven with their historical and theoretical background. During the covid period we have had ample experience with non-iP teaching, and we know that students simply do not engage as well with that.

1. to introduce the (historical, intellectual) context of the prescribed texts
2. to show in practice how to analyse passages from a speech and a speech as a whole
3. to discuss students' reading and understanding of the prescribed texts and of the relationships between rhetorical theory and practice
4. to make explicit historical and other relationships between the texts read
5. to discuss the students' reading and understanding of the prescribed secondary literature, and the methods available to check and evaluate these secondary sources against the primary ones

The seminars are used for giving students the opportunity for in-depth engagement with, and discussion about, central rhetorical problems (from the interpretation of the use of character in speeches to the issue of the morality of rhetorical manipulation).

Independent study is supposed to be used:
1. to read and analyse the prescribed (primary and secondary) literature
2. to complete the assessed assignments","Examination is important: while it also tests the skills outcomes, it particularly tests the knowledge outcomes. An exam is the best way of testing all of the latter, and the only feasible way of testing the first: it is vital that students make sure that they have a command of the facts of the court cases involved and of the overall lines of approach taken in the speeches, without being able to rely on time-consuming use of reference tools.

This module will examine the Odyssey in the context of the early Greek epic tradition surrounding the Trojan War legend, and, more specifically, will explore its relationship with the other great Homeric epic, the Iliad, studying the parallels and contrasts between portrayals of heroes and heroism, narrative technique, characterization and emotion, and thematic design.

The module aims to train students to use details of a text for analysis and appreciation of:
•Stylistic and narrative design and effects
•Thematic patterns
•The handling of emotional impact
•The handling of character portrayal and of audience sympathies

The module aims to teach students to:
•Identify characteristic features of Homeric narrative technique, including those which reflect the Odyssey’s and the Iliad’s status as works designed for oral performance.
•Explore how these may work for an audience in a performance context, especially in terms of emotional and dramatic effect.
•To develop students’ capacity for independent exploration and analysis of a literary text.",,,,,,"Lectures (which also mostly include group work on applying lecture themes to specific passages) are designed to introduce students to overall approaches to the text, its techniques and its cultural background, and to illustrate to students how these ideas may be applied to the exploration of textual detail (and vice versa), giving students the opportunity to try this latter approach also for themselves. 

Workshops give the students the opportunity to apply close reading techniques to excerpts from the texts. 

Seminars are designed to give students the opportunity to engage with issues about and approaches to the text for themselves, both in preparing an oral presentation and in preparing to participate in discussion; and also to develop students' skills of oral and interpersonal communication.","The examination will comprise a choice of commentary and essay questions.

Commentary questions assess students’ capacity to analyse passages in detail, usually as a basis for discussing characteristic features of the text as a whole. Essay questions assess students’ ability to assemble their knowledge of the text(s) studied into a coherent discussion of key overall questions about the text.

The assignment assesses the additional Stage-3 skills outcome of initiative in independent application of analytical skills. This involves a comparative approach to texts read independently, hence requiring more word count space.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Literature in the Age of Nero,20,Dr Claire Stocks,"The module will consist of reading a selection of texts from the Neronian Period or texts written about the Neronian period. Such texts may include (but are not limited to) selections from Lucan’s De Bello Ciuili, the tragedies of Seneca, Petronius’ Satyricon, and Suetonius' Life of Nero. These texts will be situated both within their political context (Rome under a princeps who is the last of the Julio-Claudians, a figure who later acquired legendary status for his decadence and despotism) and their literary context (especially in relation to how these texts negotiate their place within the epic and tragic traditions).

As part of the process for situating these texts within their context, this module will also consider how literature from the Neronian period (together with material culture) can feature in museum exhibitions and media as a means of engaging a wider audience with this material. 

Literary, cultural, religious, political and historical issues will be discussed.

This module aims to:
(1) Provide an understanding of the political and literary context of Neronian literature;
(2) Provide an understanding of the key interpretative problems raised in these texts;
(3) Provide an understanding of Neronian writers’ aims;
(4) Develop students' skills of textual interpretation, analysis and problem-solving as applied to Neronian Literature.
(5) Develop students' skills of interpersonal and written communication
(6) Encourage students to think about how to disseminate this information to a wider audience - this will allow them to reflect back upon the central themes within these texts.",,,,,,"Lectures introduce the texts and the period

The commentary assessment gives students the opportunity to work in depth with a text so that they can the skills needs to incorporate texts into bigger projects (i.e. for assessment 2)

The portfolio project will be an opportunity for students to design their own project that focuses on using literature on Nero or from the Neronian period to present their own 'Neronian story'. This could be (for example) a (virtual) exhibition space, or it could be a journal/newspaper style article, or a podcast or an audio tour or some other form of media (must be discussed in advance with the module leader who will confirm the viability of the proposed project). The literature serves as a starting point for the story that the student wishes to tell. Regardless of the format chosen by the students for delivering their work, they must provide a written copy of their text with full references and bibliography. This serves as a control mechanism with respect to word count and ensuring that students can demonstrate that they have met the learning outcomes, while still given them creative freedom. Guidelines on how the assessment will be marked (in line with existing marking criteria) will be provided. This assessment allows students to look in depth at Neronian literature and how it connects to the Neronian age and cultural context. This is an opportunity for students to explore how texts fit within their context and to explore in greater detail the relationship between literature and the world that produces it.

Seminars provide students with an opportunity to participate in discussion and thus to improve their oral communication skills. Seminar topics will be keyed to the first assessment component (Research Project).


The drop-in session at the end of the semester will give students an additional opportunity to ask questions on the material discussed throughout the module as they prepare towards the final assessment.

All sessions will be held in-person, unless covid-related guidance prevents us from doing so. In that case, class meetings will be held as synchronous on-line sessions via zoom.","The exam tests: 
(i) the acquisition of a clear general knowledge of the subject that can be deployed without recourse to handbooks or other printed or on-line resources; 
(ii) the ability to think and analyse a problem quickly, to select from and to apply both the general knowledge and detailed knowledge of aspects of the subject to new questions;
(iii) students' problem-solving skills, adaptability, and the ability to work unaided and to write effectively and concisely.

In addition to the exam, there is one written assignment (research project) in this module. This assignment asks of students to identify and critically discuss early modern or contemporary allusions or references to Greek myth that they have encountered outside of the classroom; these can derive from different media (e.g., literary texts, films, music, visual arts, cartoons, advertisment etc.). Students are asked to find the ancient sources pertaining to the mythological reference they are examining, as well as relevant secondary literature to underpin their discussion of the ways in which the myth has been adapted and the effects generated by this adaptation.

The formative assessment is intended to hone students' skills in engaging with secondary literature and provide feedback ahead of the first component of the assessment (research project).

How do we ‘see’ anything while we are asleep? Can dreams be trusted? Do they come from our soul? Our brain? The gods? Is dreaming really a 'universal' human experience?

Dreams and their interpretation posed as many questions in antiquity as they do today, and the dreams themselves took many forms: there was not simply the one standardised ‘ancient dream’. This module, then, examines the multitude of ways dreams and the dream experience appear across a wide variety of texts and sources from the ancient world and beyond, led by two key questions: where do dreams come from, and what – if anything – do they mean?

Introduce you to the broad sweep of Greek history (broadly defined) from the traditional date for the first Olympic Games (776 BC) until the Hellenistic period, highlighting key topics and themes (e.g. contact and interaction with 'foreign' peoples in Egypt, Italy or Ionia, the emergence and internal workings of the Greek city-state, Alexander's conquests and legacy).

Expand and significantly deepen your understanding of both the nature and internal workings of Greek society, including the experiences of marginalised or disenfranchised groups (women, non-resident aliens, and slaves) and the way in which modern attitudes and ideas have impacted the way we think about the past, whether this be the 'Hoplite Revolution' or concepts surrounding Race and identity.

Enable you to engage critically with scholarship dealing with historical questions which are of central importance to our wider understanding of that period (e.g. the so-called Black Athena debate, ideas about gender/sexuality).

Foster and further develop your core skills (and confidence) in using and evaluating a wide variety of literary and material evidence to answer historical questions (e.g. epic and lyric poetry, Greek coinage, painted pottery and epigraphy - the study of inscriptions).

Provide you with an accessible, exciting, and (at times) highly provocative introduction to the study of both the ancient Greeks and ancient history in general that will enable you pursue your interests successfully at Stages 2 or 3 irrespective of any prior knowledge or experience that you might possess.",,,,,,"Lectures and associated readings will introduce you to key historical topics, themes or debates. Their aim is to provide you with core knowledge and skills and thus a point of departure for further independent study. Your listening, reading and note-taking skills will play a key role in this process. 

The set tasks and ensuing seminar discussions are an opportunity for you to develop your understanding dynamically, e.g. by familiarising you with the various different forms of primary evidence selected and following the structured routes to a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the topic which will then be further developed and enhanced through discussions during the seminar itself. Active participation in the seminars will enable you to develop your analytical skills, oral communication skills and your ability to work collaboratively as part of a team. 

Two hours of the course will be spent either in the Great North Museum or in an object-handling session (or online equivalent if COVID measures are reintroduced) in order to allow you to study the material evidence first-hand rather than relying on images published in books and articles (e.g. painted vases, silver coinage). The timing of this session will allow us to revisit and significantly deepen your understanding of key topics within the course (e.g. hoplite warfare, the place of women in Greek society, Greek identity).","The commentary exercise gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to:
1. engage with both a designated piece of primary evidence and modern scholarship in an informed and critical manner; 
2. communicate clearly and effectively through written prose using conventions appropriate to the subject;  
3. employ primary evidence to support a logical structured and reasoned argument.

The take-home examination tests your acquisition of a clear, general and overall knowledge of the subject plus the ability to think and analyse a problem quickly, to select from and to apply both the general knowledge of aspects of the subject to new questions, problem-solving skills, adaptability, the ability to work unaided and to write clearly and concisely.

• structures and strategies of ancient imperialism (Greek, Macedonian, near eastern); 
• relations between different cultural groups (Greeks, Macedonians, Persians, Egyptians, Babylonians, etc.);
• power, agency, and dynamics of interaction between political actors of differing statuses;
• social and cultural issues, such as identity and belonging, from the elite to the masses;
• continuity and change in the eastern Mediterranean and ancient near east in the 4th-1st centuries BC;
• long-term and short-term perspectives on historical processes, and how the historian can integrate these.

The reflective log will consist of three short blog entries intended as a space for students to reflect on their progress against the module’s skills outcomes as well as practise writing skills.

POSTER (25% of total module grade)

The poster enables students to investigate a self-chosen piece of evidence in great depth and present the products of their research in an engaging, individually designed format - with free choice of either 750 word written piece of 5-minute recorded piece, to give students of different learning styles equal opportunity for success. As well as testing the ability to deconstruct and discuss ancient evidence, this component gives students an opportunity to show digital capability in the creative presentation of their work.

ESSAY (75% of total module grade)

The essay is a response to a question from a pre-set list, and it is intended to bring together the balance of knowledge and skills developed over the course of the module. It is an opportunity for students to apply their learning on an individual and independent basis. This builds on the work with evidence and writing practice provided in the form of the other two assessment components.

This is to be done primarily through the study of antique writers, documents, artefacts and archaeology, and by engaging in particular with the problems caused by this uneven ancient evidence, in which the views of slave-owners are well represented, while slaves seldom have an explicit voice. Understanding the modern historiography is also key, since contemporary disputes, resonances and sensitivities (e.g. the reparations debate; and movements to 'decolonize' written and physical legacies) form a further inescapable part of the context for studying this ancient topic.",,,,,,"Lectures, live (allowing for some interactive engagement) or recorded (for more intensive learning), highlight the most important themes and approaches and clarify information, building also on preparatory reading. These, plus the seminar preparation, facilitate the flipped classroom seminar, where students, singly or in groups, lead discussion and analysis of key ancient source materials. One of the essay assessments will be tied specifically to the texts studied. Tasks build up relevant skills, while the bi-weekly tests (formative assessment) on Canvas consolidate knowledge. These all feed into both essays. The end of module drop-in allows students to give and get feedback on the module and reflect on their experience.","One essay is intended to demonstrate engagement with specific ancient source material and to display skills of source-criticism, command of detail, and awareness of relevant contexts. The other essay allows engagement with a major topic or theme relevant to slavery and the development of well-considered arguments bolstered by appropriate ancient evidence and modern scholarship, suitably contextualized.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",The Fall of the Roman Republic (Inactive),20,Professor Federico Santangelo,"In this module we study the historical developments that led to the collapse of the Roman Republic and the advent of the monarchic rule of Octavian, later known as Augustus. It was a long and complex process, which spanned over more than a century and coexisted with the expansion and the development of Roman hegemony throughout the Mediterranean. 

One of the central contentions of this course will be that the fall of the Roman Republic cannot be read simply as a process of decline. On the contrary, it was a dramatic and violent period of creative change, which was part of a wider process of reaggregation and reorganisation of the Roman State and of the Empire as a whole. 

This module intends to offer an opportunity to: 

- Gain a sound general knowledge of the period, both of the narrative of the last two centuries BC and of the main historical issues of the period;  
- Read widely and critically in the primary and secondary literature about the period;
- Develop further the capacity for independent study.",,,,,,"Lectures will provide the students with a structured outline of core knowledge and methodologies that are essential for approaching the key historical topics of the module.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",'Like ants or frogs around the pond': Mobility and Identity in the Greek Mediterranean,20,Dr Joseph Skinner,"This module explores the relationship between an emerging sense of ‘Greekness’ and a variety of factors including widespread mobility (the so-called ‘men in boats’ — which must in reality have included women/children at least some of the time), consumption, and contact with 'foreign' peoples — whether as a result of trade, mercenary service overseas, violent seizure of territory or enslavement. We will be equally preoccupied, however, with tracing the way the complex and cross-cutting issues of identity, race and culture have shaped the way intercultural contact and exchange are conceptualised (e.g. in ancient stories narrating the return of heroes who fought at Troy or the migration of various prehistoric populations or modern discussion surrounding orientalizing, Hellenization, and the Barbarian stereotype). By tackling such questions head-on you will gain an enhanced and up-to-date understanding of not only the way the Greeks conceptualised their interactions with both their neighbours and each other, encapsulated in Socrates’ purported statement likening them (all) to ants or frogs around a pond, but also the way in which the discipline is responding to current trends and preoccupations (e.g. decolonising, attempts to appropriate or ‘whiten’ antiquity, or a heightened sensitivity to issues of social justice and race).",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce you to key historical topics and approaches. Lectures are not intended to provide you with answers. Instead, they will provide you with the knowledge and skills that will enable you to negotiate these complex and fascinating topics successfully and arrive at your own opinion! Throughout the module you will be encouraged (and supported) to adopt a critical standpoint in relation to both modern scholarship and key evidence e.g. vase painting, a passage from Herodotus or early Greek coinage. Your listening, reading and note-taking skills will underpin and thus play a key role in this process. The seminar discussions are an opportunity for you to develop your understanding dynamically in collaboration with fellow students as well as gaining clarification of any points that you do not understand. By participating actively in seminars you stand to develop your critical and analytical skills, your oral communication skills and your ability to work collaboratively as part of a team. You will explore set topics in detail, building on sources and modern scholarship that you have read, whether via directed readings or independent study, participate in small group and class-wide discussions, and deliver a formal presentation that demonstrates your mastery of a self-chosen topic. Four hours of the course will be spent either in the Great North Museum or in object-handling sessions (or an online equivalent, should COVID measures be reintroduced) in order to allow you to examine a variety of material and iconographic evidence first-hand whether this relates to ancient ideas about race, Greek coins or orientalizing.","The seminar workshops assess knowledge and understanding of core themes, the ability to compare and contrast source materials, and the ability to expound and criticize a textual extract lucidly and succinctly. The students' oral communication and presentation skills will be developed by their delivering a formal presentation which will be summatively assessed by the seminar leader. This will help students to develop transferable skills such as using presentation software to a professional standard and expressing complex ideas to a non-specialist audience in a clear and engaging manner. Formal training will be provided in the form of a skills session in week one and feedback will be offered on the draft handout/plan prior to the 'live' event (the formative exercise).

The Portfolio exercise tests the students’ ability to think and analyse a problem quickly, to select from and to apply both the general knowledge of aspects of the subject to new questions, problem-solving skills, adaptability, the ability to work unaided and to write clearly and concisely. The level and extent of the students' understanding of core topics (i.e. the relationship between an emerging sense of ‘Greekness’ and factors including widespread mobility, consumption of ‘luxury’ products, and contact/interaction with 'foreign' peoples) will be tested via the set question. The remaining set essay (one to be chosen from a pre-set list) and gobbet questions will test different aspects of the student's knowledge of the course overall.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Big History: From the Big Bang to Climate change,20,Dr Scott Ashley,"The aims of this module are to introduce students to the concept of ‘Big History’, an innovative and growing field of looking at the past in the broadest terms, usually figured as being from the Big Bang to the present (with some speculation as to the near-future). This concept breaks down the disciplinary divisions between arts, humanities and sciences to create a structure of foundational knowledge, telling an interconnected story of the universe, Solar System, Earth, life and humanity at the largest scales. Although invented in its Anglophone variety by a historian, David Christian, Big History explicitly looks to a variety of scientific disciplines concerned with change over time, such as astronomy, geology, and biology, alongside the more familiar Humanities and Social Science techniques of history and archaeology. By the end of the module, students will have been introduced to a broad-based ‘tool-kit’ of methods and techniques by which to interrogate both the human and non-human past. They will also have a better understanding of where the histories they will study during the rest of their time at university, as well as their own lives and times, fit into the grand narratives of the Universe, the planet, and the human species.      

The module aims are:
• To introduce students to the key themes of Big History and to encourage them to examine that theme from a variety of different perspectives.
• To encourage students to think about the past comparatively and to draw parallels, connections and contrasts between different types of evidence and different approaches to the past in its broadest scope.
• To provide an opportunity to acquire a sound general knowledge of the subject, reading widely and critically in the primary and secondary literature associated with it and to develop the capacity for independent study.",,,,,,"Lectures impart core knowledge and an outline of knowledge that students are expected to acquire and they stimulate development of listening and note-taking skills.

Field trips are designed to provide the students to experience spaces and places, including those they would be unlikely to have visited independently. These trips, thus allow students to learn in and from a different environment compared to the lecture theatre or the seminar room. The field trips allow students to use relevant observational techniques, to gain insights that can only be gained from spatial experience or the “archive of the feet” and to collect information to inform their studies.

We will consider why and how people use things in their lives. We will interpret ways in which we use things and ways in which things can exert power over us. 

As humans we surround ourselves with things which play an important part in our lives whether we recognize them as significant or not.

1) a podcast script (with references and bibliography) 
2) a podcast sound file in MP3 format (with the student’s voiceover reading the submitted text)

Assessment 2 Assemblage research paper group project

Rationale for unusual weighting of word count: 
The research paper is group work, so in practice each individual student would not write more than the individual tariff limit of 2000 words to contribute to the 3000 word group project. If reduced to the standard 2000 word:10 credit ratio, individual students would write very little for 50% of their mark. The intention with the research project is to allow  students to build the skills required for a more substantial piece of work in a team, supported by each-other and the module leader before moving towards independent research design later in their degree programs.

Students will collaborate on a project in small groups in order to explore an assemblage or artefact type. 

Student teams will design a plan and timetable for their project, to be submitted with the assessment. 
Students will also reflect on experience of the project, and include this reflection with the research paper. 

The submitted work tests intended knowledge and skills outcomes,  develops key skills in research, reading and writing.

Formative assessment - Group Presentation

As part of designing and researching the group project, students will be given an oppourtunity to present their ideas to the class prior to the assessment period. This creates a mid-way point for the assignment, develops key skills in presenting ideas and public speaking, and gives students an oppourtunity to receive and act on feedback prior to the submission of their final assessment.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Historical Sources and Methods,20,Dr Shane McCorristine,"This module introduces students to the raw materials upon which historical research is based, namely primary sources produced at the time, to encourage critical engagement with these sources, and familiarise students with a range of methods and techniques necessary to examine and interpret primary sources as historical evidence. 

While historical research frequently draws on the ideas, arguments and interpretations of other scholars, it ultimately rests on a deep and critical engagement with primary materials.  Original documents take a wide variety of forms, ranging from texts (like letters, diaries, legislation, and official reports), to visual sources (such as paintings, posters, photographs, satirical cartoons), to the material traces of the past (objects, buildings and landscapes).

The approach is not intended to be exhaustive, the rich array of primary evidence is one of the many things that makes history such a dynamic and interesting discipline, but aims to ground students in the types of source they will most commonly encounter over the course of an undergraduate degree, and to equip them with the analytical tools to critically evaluate primary sources.  We recognise that many students (although not all) will have some basic introduction to basic source analysis skills (perhaps based on thinking on who, what, when and why was produced), but this module aims to deepen and consolidate these approaches.

On successful completion of the module students will have a more critical and nuanced understanding of the circumstances in which particular sources were produced, as well as how, when, and with what purposes historians might turn to them.  Most importantly, students will appreciate that primary sources, irrespective of the forms they take, are far from transparent windows on the past.  Indeed, the primary documents available to us are a very imperfect historical record.  They are often highly mediated and selective records, shaped by decisions at the time as to what information was important, and how to record it, as well as subsequent decisions taken by archivists and other gatekeepers about what records to preserve, and how to organise that material.  Evidence then rarely, if ever, speaks for itself.  Yet with careful examination, contextualisation, and interpretation they can form the basis for research.  This module will give students the knowledge, methods, skills, experience and confidence to draw more fully on primary evidence in their work at this and subsequent stages of the degree.

Specifically, the module will 
•        introduce students in a supported way to some of the basic typologies of primary source materials, most notably, archival/textual, visual, aural/oral, material, and particular forms of source material within these categories.
•        Develop the critical source analysis skills required at undergraduate level, including how to identify the key features and provenance of sources
•        Introduce students to a variety of techniques in engaging with primary sources e.g. reading against the grain, placing sources into context, triangulation between sources.
•        Give students experience of how to find and access primary materials, particularly in online / digitised resources freely available, and the resources hosted and subscribed to by the university.
•        Be introduced to the University’s Special Collections & Archives team and their collections as a key resource for their three years at Newcastle; 
•        teach students how to reference different types of primary sources, and where to look for information about specific referencing practices
•        Develop the students’ abilities and confidence in writing a research essay based on primary sources.
•        link the content and approach of this module to Evidence & Argument, complementing its focus on historiography through an examination of the methodologies required to work with particular forms of source material.",,,,,,"As a Stage 1 module, aside from an in-depth understanding of the content of the module, the teaching methods, which focus on small group work, presentational and oral skills, team work, online lecture delivery and independent research and writing, relate to the core learning outcomes of supporting students in developing sophisticated research skills across a wide range of sources, being able to synthesise the information they collect and form convincing and coherent arguments. 

Independent learning is essential to this module: students are expected to develop skills of source evaluation, critical reading and note-taking in an independent and effective manner. Seminar teaching complements these skills by allowing students the opportunity to share and debate information gathered independently. Moreover, a significant part of seminar teaching will test the development of primary source analysis and problem solving.

Small group teaching will allow the students to explore ideas and patterns together in a structured way, and great emphasis will be placed on primary sources and their interpretation. Online lectures will enable students to learn about a new source type each week and thereby complement and inform the work they are doing in seminars. A workshop with teaching staff will help them engage with materials drawn from Special Collections, giving some insight into the wealth of documents on the doorstep and encouraging the further use of SC in their degree. Students will be supported in their assessments and progress through drop-in surgeries where they can bring any academic issues to the SL for discussion.","This module (1) supports and assesses student progression to university and (2) endeavours to support their skills development, including academic and employability. 

The formative written exercise introduces students to the practice of writing a source analysis/commentary of a primary document/image/material. This is intended to develop their skills in summarising, contextualising, and interpreting a source within a limited word count. The formative written exercise which precedes this will give students a chance to practice this and work with the feedback provided by their seminar leaders. 

The research essay introduces students to the nature of independent engagement with primary sources databases at university level. They will be given some choice in deciding with primary source database/document they would like to interrogate (all provided via links on Canvas) and the task is to craft some arguments out of these sources.

The module is organized chronologically by region, in order to introduce students to the great diversity of peoples, cultures, and climates that characterize the African continent. In this module, students will learn that Africa was never the “dark continent” that it is often supposed to be. A major focus of the module will be Africa’s engagement with the outside world, including the trans-Saharan trade, Swahili city-states and the Indian Ocean, and Trans-Atlantic trade. The module will stress continuity across time periods in order to highlight the lasting impact of historical processes, especially the slave trade and European colonialism.

•        Introduce students to multidisciplinary methods and sources used to recover the African past.
•        Explore the challenges of “doing history” by evaluating historical interpretations.
•        Introduce students to crafting their own arguments about the African past.",,,,,,"Our teaching strategy is based on a flipped classroom. Students are expected to come to class having completed the assigned reading in order to fully participate in active learning, lead by in-classroom activities. Lectures and non-synchronous lecture materials will introduce topics and provide expert orientation and exposition on a broad range of themes and issues, supplemented by the module reading list. In-person lectures will provide opportunities for dialogue, while lecture materials can be reviewed at any time across the week and revisited numerous times afterwards. In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced, there is the capacity to present recorded materials asynchronously and retain timetabled slots for live discussion of these materials. 

Seminars are spaces for students to workshop specific case studies, developing the competencies in the multidisciplinary methodologies and analytical skills targeted in the module aims.","Informed by pedagogical research, this course adopts an outcome based assessment model. In order to ensure accessibility to socially and neurologically diverse student population, this course uses scaffolded written assignments to build critical writing skills, facility with the material and historical research. Each written assignment focuses on one skill, allowing students to improve throughout the semester. The formative assessment introduces the skill of crafting an argumentative thesis statement and gives students the opportunity to get feedback on an outline of the second assessment. The second essay develops student understanding of triangulating between multidisciplinary methods and sources. The last essay builds on the argumentative and methodological skills of the first two essays, inviting students to demonstrate the knowledge they have acquired in the module by asking students to trace a global theme across time and space.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Oral History and Memory,20,Dr Sarah Campbell,"Memories are living history and over the past seventy years, oral history has transformed the practice of contemporary history in many countries. This module will provide an overview of the historical development of oral history as a research method for historians, develop students’ awareness of memory as a historical source and explore the changing uses of both since the 1950s. Through the use of a theme each year, students will examine the possibilities of using oral history as a way of understanding the past; develop an awareness of the ethical and practical issues involved and develop skills required to research, design, manage and undertake oral history interviews either in person or remotely.

There is a practical oral history project component to this module. You will work as part of a group on a topic related to a theme in contemporary history (there will be a theme each year) and conduct an oral history interview. This element of the module will provide you with experience in interviewing, transcribing, and analysis of oral histories, as well as exploring how they could be used in public histories.

The aims of this module are:
-        To introduce students to the benefits and ethical challenges of using oral history as a methodology;
-        To help students to understand the challenges of combining theory and practice through the first-hand experience of interviewing;
-        To introduce students to recent historical research and to guide them in the analysis of theories and texts;
-        To give students the opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge of recent history;
-        To give students an awareness of recording technologies and transcription;
-        To guide students in planning and accomplishing a successful oral history project.",,,,,,"Lectures impart core knowledge and provide an outline for further knowledge acquisition by the students themselves.Lectures allow students to develop skills in comprehension and note-taking.

Lectures also facilitate the critical appreciation of such sources.

Workshops explore oral history skills, ethics and working with recording equipment. It will be workshop style of working in groups and practising skills. 

Fieldwork allows students to engage reflectively with the practice of oral history and interviewing.

Group activity and project work allows for students in a peer context to articulate and consolidate their understanding of the theme of the module and the practice of oral history.


Seminars allow students to discuss and assimilate understanding of oral history, memory and the specified theme of British history. 

Drop-in surgery will allow students explore and test their knowledge of oral history and social memory prior to assessment.","The project work and its presentation are specifically designed to encourage the students to develop and to test, skills that will be invaluable in collaborative oral history projects and disseminating their results. 

The essay tests intended knowledge and skills outcomes and develops key skills in research, reading and writing in relation to oral history, social memory and the specified theme of British history. Work submitted during the delivery of the module forms a means of determining student progress.

It was a year of seismic social and political change globally. From the anti-Vietnam war and civil rights movements in the United States, student protests and revolutions across Europe, the rise of the New Left, and the emergence of second-wave feminism, the ‘1968 moment’ is central to understanding the second half of the twentieth century. This module will highlight the similarities and differences in the 1968 experience across four key case studies: France, Germany, United States, and Northern Ireland. It will take a thematic approach, intersecting macro- and micro-level analysis and case studies. It will encourage students to consider the ‘1968 years’ as a significant moment between postwar austerity and the Thatcher-Reagan years, and examine whether there is a common 1968 experience or conflicting ideals.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Contesting Reproductive Rights in the UK and Ireland,20,Dr Vicky Long,"The regulation of reproductive rights has evoked strong reactions over the course of the twentieth-century, and continues to polarise opinions today. Women’s rights to access abortion vary significantly, both globally and within Europe, and while in many respects women’s access to legal abortion has expanded over the last 100 years, this picture is not universal, and it is far from clear that this direction of travel will be maintained.

The module situates debates about access to, and regulation of, abortion within a broader framework of reproductive rights, regulations, and bioethics. It focuses on the UK and Ireland, where abortion provisions diverge significantly, despite geographical proximity, situating this picture within a broader international picture to tease out generalizable and distinctive features. Structurally, it entwines a loosely chronological with a thematic approach, intersecting macro- and micro-level analysis and case studies. While pro-natalist policies predominated in the early years of the twentieth century, national policies and practices diverged over the course of the century, shaped in non-linear ways by medical politics, feminism, sexual politics, eugenics, and discourses about disability, politics, economics and religion. This module encourages students to evaluate the role played by these factors in shaping policy, practice, experience and activism, and reconfiguring debates about rights, choice and autonomy in different eras and locations. Feminist activism, for example, has been a driving force behind campaigns to legalise and protect access to abortion, but has also played a role in campaigns for better provisions for mothers. Efforts to restrict the right to reproduce often targeted disabled people, but some disabled people and their advocates in turn have sought to restrict people’s rights to access abortion on the grounds of foetal abnormality.",,,,,,"SEMINARS encourage independent study and promote improvements in oral presentation, interpersonal communication, problem-solving skills, research skills and adaptability.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","War, Wounds, and Disabilities in the Modern Russian, American and British Worlds",20,Professor Susan-Mary Grant,"This module seeks to introduce second-year (level 5) under-graduate students to the important and rapidly developing field of war and its many physical and psychological impacts on individuals and their societies, The focus is on Russia and the Soviet Union, Europe more broadly, the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. It explores the social and medical reactions to the disabling effects of war on the bodies and minds of war combatants and their families. 

Given the expertise of the contributors, this module takes a comparative and thematic approach to war-related disability.  Although special reference is paid to how war wounding and disability was constructed and experienced in the North American, Russian/Soviet, and British cases, both its geographical frame of reference and its social and medical history approach is much broader and includes the coverage of thematic topics such as the examination of immigrant exclusion from Australia and New Zealand, for example, the brief but influential fascination with neurasthenia (the mental stress brought on by both military engagement and modernity) or the related history of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) or the implications of the transition from soldier to civilian in modern conflict.

Over the course of a programme of lectures and seminars students will explore the multiple ways in which warfare maimed, injured, disfigured and impaired soldiers, and how veterans and the societies to which they returned classified, treated, compensated and cared for the war-disabled. Specific forms of disability, and how they were constructed and handled by different societies will be considered. As well as exploring disabilities themselves, the module will explore institutional and domestic histories of care, issues of gender and masculinity, and the social experience of disability more broadly.

On successful competition of the module students will be well-acquainted with the principal methods, approaches and sources that inform disability in a martial context, and be able to apply them to the specific focus of the module and to the present-day issues raised by conflict.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Germany and Central Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,20,Professor Daniel Siemens,"This module builds on the highly popular module HIS2241. It draws upon the expertise of additional members of staff in such a way as to expand both the chronological and geographical scope. To include Central Europe will allow us to discuss modern German history in a wider geographical and geopolitical context. It will provide students with a better understanding of the complexities of the region and the different identities of its people(s), including those who did not fit national frameworks. At the same time, this module will include popular topics like National Socialism and the GDR and will thus serve as a useful preparation to our special subject modules in year three. It will also make a case for the importance on historiography, as we can make the students aware of the very different readings of the past, depending on the national and political positions. 

The overall aim of this module is thus twofold: On the one hand, this module will provide students with key knowledge about the history of Central Europe from the time of the Napoleonic wars to the present day. On the other hand, it will also enable them to understand, analyse and challenge the different narratives that were used over the last two hundred years to write the histories of these regions/states.

empires and nations states,
5. To question some of our societal understandings of important concepts such as that of identity and
national belonging, and

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Land and Society in the USA, Ireland and Scotland, c. 1840-1922",20,Professor Annie Tindley,"The aims of this module are two-fold:

1. To introduce and immerse the students in critical reflection around the social, cultural, economic and political aspects of how land issues drove and impacted on Britain, the USA and Ireland, with a heavy emphasis on linking these three case studies to the emerging field of environmental humanities. There is an extensive literature on these themes, and material from cognate disciplines (geography; sociology; landscape studies/fiction/poetry) will be included. 

2. To support the students to better identify then develop their skills, including those traditionally associated with History teaching (independent research and study; critical and reflective thinking; information literacy; written expression), and broader skills associated with employability (oral and personal presentation; team work; managing different audiences; entrepreneurialism). 

Both aims are addressed in the teaching content and methods and in the assessment types. The module also aims to support the wider progression of the students and what is expected from them at Stage 2, building on their foundational Stage 1 year and preparing them for Stage 3.",,,,,,"As a Stage 2 module, aside from an in-depth understanding of the content of the module, the teaching methods, which focus on small group work, presentational and oral skills, team work, lecture delivery and independent research and writing, relate to the core learning outcomes of supporting students in developing sophisticated research skills across a wide range of sources, being able to synthesise the information they collect and form convincing and coherent arguments. 

Independent learning is essential to this module: students are expected to develop skills of source evaluation, critical reading and note-taking in an independent and effective manner. Seminar teaching complements these skills by allowing students the opportunity to share and debate information gathered independently. In addition, students will be required to work in small teams to deliver a poster and oral presentation, enhancing their team-working experience and skills. Oral skills of argument and presentation will be developed. Moreover, a significant part of seminar teaching will test the development of primary source analysis and problem solving.

SEMINARS encourage independent study and promote improvements in oral presentation, interpersonal communication, problem-solving skills, research skills and adaptability.

LECTURES enable students to gain a wider sense of historical argument and debate and how such debates operate, which also allows them to develop comparisons between different historiographical debates.","This module (1) supports and assesses student progression at Stage 2 and (2) endeavours to support their skills development, including academic and employability. 

1. Work submitted during the delivery of the module forms a means of determining the student’s progress.

A formative exercise of a research proposal will be set for this module. It will be un-assessed, but will be discussed in the seminars, will support students develop their ideas for the research essay and their research design skills generally and will feed into the assessed work.


Presentation: Students will be allocated into groups of 3 at the beginning of the module and will be required to select a topic around which they will research, design and produce (via PowerPoint slide) a poster, which they will them collectively present in seminar.

The group work element requires students to work as part of a team, set their own deadlines and goals, allocate work together and then present it. Organisational and time management skills are to the fore here. The research essay emphasises independent thinking and learning (supported by the Module Team), research literacy and finding skills, writing and structuring skills and working to deadlines.  

Work submitted during the delivery of the module (i.e. the group presentation and poster) forms a means of determining student progress. Submitted work tests intended knowledge and skills outcomes, develops key skills in research, reading and writing.

Research essay: this prepares students for longer and more in-depth research practices in History in stage 3 including: developing research questions and methodologies; sourcing data and writing / constructing an argument. The essay will be comparative in approach, ensuring students engage with the transnational and comparative methodologies explored during the module.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Violence in the American South: From Enslavement to Civil Rights,20,Professor Susan-Mary Grant,"This module seeks to introduce students to the central roles that violence (and nonviolence) played in the social and political history of the American South during the course of and since the American Civil War (1861-1865).  

The American South is an unusual region in many ways, not least because of its perceived (and actual) relationship with violence.  On the one hand, observers going back to the antebellum period noted that the South was exceptionally violent, a situation clearly based on the region’s dependence on slavery and later continued in the form of lynching.  On the other hand, during the civil rights movement, a fusion of black Christianity with Ghandian principles showed the power of nonviolent direct action to overturn the segregated order. And those developments were in constant tension with African Americans who insisted that armed self-defence was necessary to answer unrelenting white racial violence.

This module places the American South and its violent history in the larger context of violence in America from the nation's inception to the present day. It revolves around three main focal themes/subjects:

1. Race and violence

2. White society and violence

3. The opposition to violence",,,,,,"1. Lectures impart core knowledge and an outline for further knowledge acquisition by the students themselves. They explain key historical concepts and identify historical debates and points of contention.  They introduce a range of source materials and images appropriate to the module, and facilitate the critical appreciation of such sources.

4. SEMINARS encourage independent study and promote improvements in oral presentation, interpersonal communication, problem-solving skills, research skills and adaptability.

5. LECTURE MATERIALS (under Structured Guided Learning): Documentary Analyses to aid students in working through and using primary material. They introduce and take students through either an individual primary document or a particular source collection to enhance research skills. The material analyzed will come into seminar dicussion(s), when students are expected to assess the extent to which the historiography (book or article(s)) is supported or contradicted by the primary documents looked at.

It aims to survey a broad range of countries, within about a decade after the end of the War. 

Core themes include:
-Justice: How did war crimes trials work? What similarities and differences were there between the trials in Nuremberg and Tokyo? How did different countries deal with people accused of collaborating with an occupation regime? 

-Ongoing conflict: How did the Second World War spawn or transform other conflicts that continued in its aftermath?

-Reconstruction and healing: How did societies reconstruct from the damage of the War? What happened to refugees, the wounded, and traumatized? How did soldiers reintegrate into civilian life? In what ways were post-War social welfare initiatives shaped by the legacy of the War? 

-The post-war political order. The post-war decade saw a dramatic and rapid transformation of the global political order. In Asia, the European colonies in South and Southeast Asia, and Japanese colonies in East Asia all gained their independence; while in Europe, Cold War divisions emerged alongside plans for integration in Western Europe. The module considers how these transformations were shaped by the legacies of War. 

These questions will be pursued comparatively.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Revolutions of the Mind: European Thought, 1550�1750",20,Dr Katie East,"The word Renaissance means a rebirth: beginning in Italy in the fourteenth century, the rediscovery of the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome breathed new life into the arts, literature, and learning. By the end of the sixteenth century, these influences had spread northwards – to France, the Low Countries, and, eventually, to England. Yet the same period when Europeans looked back to the classical past is known to historians as ‘early modern’. The age of ancient philosophy was also an era of cutting-edge science. The same men and women who pored over the Scriptures with Hebrew and Greek lexicons looked with telescopes at the stars. They prayed for their souls and pondered new fundamental theories in physics and philosophy. Within another two centuries, these different impulses threatened to tear apart established world views, so that by the end of the seventeenth century a new dawn of revolutionary modernity was on the horizon.

This module introduces students to the world of European ideas between the late Renaissance and the early Enlightenment – roughly the period from 1550 to 1750. Through the close study of primary sources, it will uncover what people during this period thought, how they argued, and why their ideas had such revolutionary consequences in religion, science, philosophy, and politics. Topics will thus range widely: from the dissident Jewish thinker Baruch Spinoza’s revolutionary reading of the Bible to the world-changing cosmology of Galileo; from the attempts of Europeans to learn the languages and reassemble the histories of the Ottoman Empire, China, and South America to the vision of the commonwealth at home sketched by the much-reviled Englishman Thomas Hobbes; from the Renaissance commitment to Aristotle’s natural world to the Royal Society, Isaac Newton and their ‘New Science’. 

Students will also interrogate how, as historians, we can place these ideas in context. The age-old universities’ monopoly on learning was challenged during this period by new scientific societies, which, in turn, were forced to defend themselves against the charges of atheism and irrelevance. The printing press continued to expand the reach of the written word; yet manuscripts, too, remained vital: ideas were argued over in letters, worked out in commonplace books, and scribbled in the margins of scholars’ books. Correspondence, traditions of educational travel, and codes of sociability and friendship cohered into what many historians have identified as a ‘Republic of Letters’ – an ideal polity in which the virtues of learning might (or sometimes might not) transcend local allegiances to church and state. 

Students will also reflect critically on how we ought to understand these longue durée changes in the history of ideas. How did discoveries in science or historical scholarship affect debates in theology or philosophy?  Should continuity take precedence over change? How useful is the notion of the ‘early Enlightenment’ inherited from the twentieth-century scholar Paul Hazard? And what kind of Enlightenment – radical, moderate, conservative, clerical – did these developments in learning set in motion?",,,,,,"Lectures:

If they are lucky Key Stage 1 pupils get a brief introduction to the Great Fire of London, while at Key Stage 2 the Tudors (generally Henry VIII and Elizabeth I) get a mention somewhere between the Normans and the World Wars. Yet this is one of the most exciting and fascinating periods in our nation's history. It has everything the budding historian might wish for: colourful characters, war, brutal executions, regime change and international exploration. It also laid the foundations for many of the institutions and ideas we take for granted today: parliamentary democracy; religious diversity and toleration; a world dominated by print; while also sowing the seeds of some less edifying aspects of our history such as the British Empire.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",The Supernatural: The Cultural History of Occult Forces,20,Dr Shane McCorristine,"Can we believe what we see and experience? Witchcraft, astrology, ghost-seeing and every kind of popular magic flourished in Britain and Europe between 1500-1900, while at the same time philosophers, scientists, clergymen, and ordinary people made judgements about what was believable and credible, unbelievable and incredible, natural and supernatural. 

There are cultural and social histories behind the construction of the supernatural: through lectures and seminars this module will guide students through some of the key texts and debates associated with diverse supernatural phenomena. From sightings of the Devil to visions of ghosts to photographs of auras, the visual sense has been trusted and mistrusted throughout history, a battlefield which tells us much about the evolution of modern psychology. 

This module will particularly explore Max Weber’s “disenchantment of the world” hypothesis that science and enlightenment demystified modern western societies and eroded beliefs in the supernatural. It has become a frequent reference point for historians looking at early modern and modern social and cultural history. However, this was not the end of the story for supernatural beliefs and practice, as recent historical work has shown in thrilling detail the extent of ‘magical thinking’ in contemporary times.",,,,,,"As a Stage 2 module, aside from an in-depth understanding of the content of the module, the teaching methods, which focus on small group work, oral skills, team work, lecture delivery and independent research and writing, relate to the core learning outcomes of supporting students in developing sophisticated research skills across a wide range of sources, being able to synthesise the information they collect and form convincing and coherent arguments.

Moreover, a significant part of seminar teaching will test the development of primary source analysis and problem solving.

Lectures will be a mix of synchronous and asynchronous to allow for more flexibility of access for students. The lecture materials comprise 7 hours and these will give students the chance to know in advance what is coming, and prepare for the seminar alongside a recording. Small group teaching will allow the students to explore ideas and patterns together in a structured way, and great emphasis will be placed on primary sources and their interpretation. This is why there will be a recorded workshop, helping students to work with documents and make them part of their writing.","Essay 1:

Students will be asked to select from a list of essay questions or to develop their personal interests by devising their own question, with the ML approval. Use of primary sources will be expected. 2500 words. This will encourage the students to conduct research when devising their essay, using the wealth of sources outlined in the Handbook, and allowing them to develop their critical writing skills. 

Reflective log 1: students will be tasked with visiting a local site (church/archive/library/historic building, etc.) in order to research and reflect on the supernatural history/story/stories they contain. They will then produce a pdf document - max 1000 words - containing details of the research and how it connects with themes in the module.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Global Environmental History: From the Little Ice Age to Greta Thunberg,20,Dr David Hope,"This module explores the way in which humans have transformed the environment and how the natural world has shaped societies, cultures, and economies across the globe. It focuses on the period from the sixteenth to twenty-first centuries, from the so-called Little Ice Age which started around 1500 and brings it up to the modern day in the age of the Climate Emergency. The module uses case studies from Britain, the Americas, Europe, the Indian subcontinent, East Asia, the Pacific, and beyond to offer wide-ranging perspectives on the history of human-environment relationships across the world. 

In the age of climate crisis, the module provides vital reflections on the historical roots of the many environmental challenges facing the modern world. The module focuses on a key period in which humanity has intensified its impact on global ecology, including: the depletion of natural resources; the transplanting of flora, fauna, and invasive species across continents; pollution; species extinction; industrial/commercial agriculture; the burning of fossil fuels, and rapid urbanisation and population growth. In addition, the module explores the ways in which the environment has directly impacted human societies such as ‘natural’ disasters, the Little Ice Age, and health. It also examines ideas and attitudes towards the environment including sustainability, conservation and environmental activism, the meaning of nature itself and how landscapes are imagined, and the concept of the Anthropocene — the idea that we have entered a new geological epoch that is defined by humanity’s impact on the natural world. 

The module features several workshops that cover: (1) primary sources for the study of environmental history (including use of resources at the Great North Museum and the Archive and Library of the Natural History Society of Northumbria); (2) maps as historical sources and digital mapping; (3) how to create a Story Map; and (4) planning and designing a Story Map. These workshops support the preparation of the summative creative project (an ArcGIS StoryMap). The Story Map requires students to reflect on the historical roots of a present-day environmental issue and/or a key theme in environmental history and develops participants’ digital skills and ability to construct and communicate a compelling narrative and argument using primary sources, maps, and data visualisations. There is also the opportunity to go on a fieldtrip to local sites that are connected to some of the module’s key themes (possibly Jesmond Dene, the Town Moor, the Quayside, and/or Gosforth Nature Park).

Through engagement with environmental, social, economic, cultural, and global history, the module enables students to acquire a broad and detailed knowledge of human-environment interactions over the past five centuries and how colonialism, industrialisation, population growth, and Enlightenment ideas about ‘improvement’ have fundamentally reshaped local ecologies and our ‘Blue Planet’. Further aims include:

- Develop confidence in the ability to interpret maps, other primary source material, and inter-disciplinary approaches that historians use to study the environment and human relationships with it.
- Raise capacity for independent thinking by requiring students to undertake their own creative project (with guidance) that reflects on the historical roots of a present-day environmental issue and/or a key theme in environmental history.
- Introduce students to major historical interpretations in environmental history and encourage them to make connections between different regions and continents.",,,,,,"The combination of in-person lectures, seminars, and workshops are designed to encourage an active and student-led approach to learning. Lectures provide a foundational knowledge of core themes and are active learning experiences that use technology enhanced learning to provide instant feedback on students’ progress. Workshops provide students with the skills to analyse and locate primary sources used by historians to study environmental history, digital mapping, and supports the preparation of their independent creative project. Seminars allow for the discussion of relevant historiographical interpretations, encourages independent study, and promotes improvement in oral presentation, interpersonal communication, problem-solving skills, and adaptability. Preparation for seminars and workshops requires students to read and critically analyse a wide range of primary sources and secondary literature: a programme of private reading that requires good time management and personal responsibility for learning. The fieldtrip develops students’ ability to interpret the history of landscapes and the human-environmental relationships embedded within them. 

In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced, there is the capacity to hold live seminar and workshop discussions online and retain timetabled slots.","The essay assesses the acquisition of a clear general knowledge of the subject, as well as the ability to locate and synthesise relevant information, engage with relevant historiographical debates, and express complex ideas in written form using appropriate scholarly sources. The project plan (formative assessment) supports the design and preparation of the independent creative project by requiring students to outline their chosen key theme in environmental history, and the primary sources and data visualisations they will use. This provides scaffolding for the creative project in which students are expected to engage with this type of evidence and analysis. The creative project evaluates students’ ability to reflect on the historical roots of a present-day environmental issue and/or a key theme in environmental history. Students are expected to formulate their own project (with guidance) which further assists their proficiency to work independently and increases their investment in the module.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Diversities of Sexuality and Gender in History,20,Dr Willow Berridge,"This module aims to survey diversities of sexuality and gender expression throughout history, as well as the manifold discourses and regulatory systems that have sought to restrain this diversity. In particular, it challenges students to explore the multiple experiences and contexts that have shaped the emergence of both modern and pre-modern identity labels. Did the gender binary as we understand it exist in the Byzantium of late antiquity, or pre-colonial Igboland? Is our understanding of what it means to be ‘gay’ or ‘transgender’ specific to the era of Western modernity? Was Kabaka Mwanga of Buganda, denounced as a ‘sodomite’ by Christian missionaries, ‘homosexual’ in the same way as Alan Turing? And why have modern governments, religious movements and police systems found sexual otherness so threatening?

Aims:
-        To familiarise students with the range of different expressions of non-normative gender and sexuality across the Ancient, Medieval, and Modern eras. 
-        To identify the various means through which hegemonic cultures have sought to marginalize, repress and erase forms of sexual otherness they deem threatening.
-        To provide an awareness of complex debates concerning identity labels",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce topics and provide expert orientation and exposition on a broad range of themes and issues concerning historical diversities of gender and sexuality as well as the discourses about them, to be supplemented by the module reading list.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Reading History,20,Dr Luc Racaut,"This module represents one of the capstones of the Newcastle history degree programme. Constructed around the study of a single seminal secondary text, it is designed to enable students to explore the themes, evidence, approach, argument, literary merit and methodology of said text within the broader context of the historiography within which it is positioned and the intellectual skills acquired at Stages 1 and 2 of the Newcastle degree programme, and to employ these in a genuinely independent and intellectually robust way as preparation both for the writing of a dissertation (the 'Writing History' module) if appropriate and for the challenges of the world beyond academia.

This module aims:

1.To encourage in students the habit of considering new arguments and evidence, not within the confines of a particular module's subject matter but in the light of all the historical knowledge that they already possess. 

2.To enable students to relate particular areas of historical knowledge to:
i.Other areas of knowledge and issues arising from different modules taken during the three years of their Honours Programme
ii.General historical knowledge other than that acquired through taught modules (e.g. by private reading, from television etc)
iii.Ethical, cultural and political issues and debates

It is often claimed that during this reign England finally became a ‘Protestant country’, but we will see that this is hugely debatable and that the processes by which faith changed were often controversial and unstable, produced dissent, plurality and rebellion. Examining how the many different shades of Christianity which emerged after the Reformation lived alongside each other in harmony (or not) will be a major aim of the module. To what extent was this an intolerant society, or even a persecuting one?

Students will engage with the legal, liturgical and doctrinal aspects of this transformation, but also to assess it as a process of cultural transition, involving accommodation and negotiation between rulers and ruled, and between neighbours. The recent historiography of the Elizabethan Reformation (and of its sub-fields like Puritanism and Catholicism) has been particularly lively and contentious, and as the module develops, students will increasingly familiarize themselves with this literature, and demonstrate a capacity to assess it critically.

What explains collective violence in China during the Cultural Revolution, and the protests and crackdowns in Taiwan? What have been the legacies of violence and division? And, how were visions of Maoist socialism in China and capitalism under one-party rule in Taiwan translated into everyday reality?

Students also learn how to critically evaluate methodologies for studying the the social history of China and Taiwan during the Cold War. Social history is especially difficult in China, where the Communist Party has always exercised a high degree of control over information. This affected record-keeping practices in the Maoist era, and has shaped access to archives and the nature of public memory in subsequent eras. Even in Taiwan, where records are significantly more open, the legacy of a dictatorship and highly divided society in the Cold War era presents special problems for social historians.",,,,,,"Small-group teaching provides students with an opportunity to summarize and ask questions about the readings, and to improve their ability to engage in debate and discussion.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",The Great Patriotic War and its Aftermath (Inactive),20,Dr Robert Dale,"This module seeks to explore the social, economic, political and cultural history of the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945), and the late Stalinist period (1945-1953).  The Soviet Union’s victory in 1945, after the catastrophic defeats of 1941 and 1942, was one of the most remarkable turnarounds in a society’s military efforts and war effort in modern history.  However, the Great Patriotic War was won at a terrible economic and social cost.  Approximately 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, and vast swathes of Soviet territory, including some of its most economically advanced regions lay in ruins.  This module examines how the Great Patriotic War was won, the ways in which waging modern industrialised warfare transformed Soviet Stalinism, and the lasting effects of the war on late Stalinist society.  The module will examine both the effects of the war on high politics, government and the planned economy, as well as the lives of ‘ordinary’ citizens.  The seminars will explore the wide and vibrant recent scholarship of the war and the immediate postwar period, as well as a variety of primary documents, including official reports, visual propaganda, memoirs, letters, literature and statistics.  

The module aims are:
1) For students to have a detailed knowledge and understanding of the history of the Soviet war effort and the reconstruction of Soviet society from the start of the war in June 1941 through to Stalin’s death in March 1953.
2) For students to have an in depth understanding of the historiographical debates surrounding the political, economic, social and cultural history of the Soviet war effort and the reconstruction of Soviet society.
3) For students to consider to what extent the experience of the Great Patriotic War relaunched the Soviet project.
4) For students to conduct research using primary sources (including visual sources, documents in translation from Russian, and materials originally produced in English) and to bring that primary research to bear on historiographical debates.
5) To improve students' skills in analysing and interpreting a range of Soviet primary sources from across the period.",,,,,,"Seminars are designed to encourage students to engage directly with a wide range of primary and secondary source materials, and to raise and discuss the issues that are explored in the historiography of the topic under consideration.  Seminars give students the opportunity to actively engage with these debates, and to interrogate source materials for themselves.  Seminars are intended to be student-led and facilitated by the module leader, and will hinge upon smaller and larger group discussions in response to questions and source materials circulated in advance. Seminars are an important forum for students to develop their own ideas and arguments in the light of wider discussion.  

In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced (especially in response to the public health situation) there is the capacity to hold live seminar discussions online and retain timetabled slots.

Lectures in this module are intended to support and augment the seminar discussions, by introducing students to particularly important debates, or to take the form of lectures explaining how to read, interpret and work with a variety of different forms of Soviet primary documents, many of which will be unfamiliar to students. Some of these lectures will explain and provide advice and support about how to write for pieces of assessment, and how to use primary documents in both documentary commentaries and essays.  Lectures then are intended to cover aligned topics, and offer guidance in how to examine particular evidence.

In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced, there is the capacity to present recorded lecture materials asynchronously.


There will also be opportunity for surgery/drop in time to support work on assessments in Office Hour (Feedback, Guidance and Consultation Hours.","The formative assessment for the module will take the form of a short 10 minute presentation on a particular topic, introducing the topic to the rest of the group. To support this a student will produce a short handout of maximum 500 words (and potential many fewer) which accompanies the presentation. This will enable students to begin to research a particular topic, and develop important presentation skills, and verbal reasoning skills. 

The documentary commentary exercise tests knowledge and understanding of the primary sources examined throughout the module. The ability to compare and contrast related primary sources, and explore how they should be interpreted and the relevance to contemporary scholarly debates is an important historical skills. The ability to expound and criticize a textual extract lucidly, succinctly and with relevance in a relatively brief word count tests key historical, analytical and writing skills. In addition, this forms of assessment closely replicates the source commentary questions previously set in examinations for this module in previous academic year, albeit in a different format appropriate for the current situation.

The final essay for the module tests both students' knowledge and understanding of key historiographical questions in the study of the Great Patriotic War, and its aftermath, and provides an opportunity for students to develop their own historical arguments supported by the primary evidence that they have been looking at over the course of the module. This form of research-led question rewards steady and incremental engagement with the issues explored in the module, and allows students to bring ideas developed from seminars to bear of a major historical question. 

Seminar preparation will help students to develop the skills required to select, prioritise and interpret a wealth of evidence and then use this evidence to support their arguments in their assessed work.  All students will deliver a presentation on a prearranged theme, and provide a written handout to accompany and structure that presentation.

These activities will inform the structured research and reading activities, which will allow students to use the knowledge acquired through the learning materials to produce their own responses and ideas to the material. These ideas will then be presented and discussed in small group teaching (seminars), encouraging independent learning, discussion, and debate, while also guiding students on how to approach primary sources and historiography in a critical and effective manner, 

The combination of lectures, structured research/reading exercises (such as discussion boards) and seminars is designed to encourage an active and student-led approach to learning. Lectures are intended to introduce core themes, impart core knowledge and an outline of knowledge that students are expected to acquire by providing a guide to key reading. They will require students to practice note-taking and active  and stimulate the development of these skills. Seminars encourage independent study and promote improvements in oral, interpersonal communication, problem-solving skills and adaptability.

Seminar preparation will require the student to read and analyse critically a selective range of literature available online or via Canvas.","The shorter written exercises will take place during the semester, and will focus on analysis and contextual framing of primary sources (set against key historiographical perspectives), allowing the accumulation of understanding and analytical skills enhancement, and the tracking and informing of student progress. The final essay will test both knowledge and understanding, and the students’ ability to synthesise and evaluate the themes studied during the module.

The essay and written exercises test acquisition of a clear general knowledge of the subject plus the ability to think and analyse sources, pertinent questions and issues; ability to select from and to apply both the general knowledge and detailed knowledge of aspects of the subject to new questions; and help to develop problem-solving skills, adaptability, independent research and the ability to write clearly and concisely.

How could former slaves find a place in new social and political systems?  What effects would the integration of the region into national economic structures have on the lives of its inhabitants?  This course examines these questions, studying the rise and fall of African American political power during Reconstruction, the changes in agriculture and the rise of industrialisation, racial violence and the origins of the segregation and disfranchisement of African Americans, and the fate of Progressive Era reform in the South.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Living Together: Christians, Muslims and Jews in Medieval Iberia",20,Dr Nicola Clarke,"Medieval Iberia, meeting place of monotheisms, has attracted more than its fair share of extravagant claims over the years. At their most intemperate, assessments of Iberia have lauded it as a wonderland of inter-religious tolerance – sometimes expressed by the concept of convivencia, or ‘living together’ – or else lamented it as a war-torn warning that multiculturalism is always doomed to fail. Hyperbole aside, Iberia offers us the chance to see how medieval societies coped with religious and cultural difference in both war and peace. Social norms, legal frameworks, architectural styles and the rhetorics of political legitimacy are all testament to the patchwork of accommodation, repression and anxiety that was life in medieval Iberia, on both the Muslim and the Christian sides of the territorial divide.

This module will explore the experiences of Muslims, Christians and Jews in the peninsula as political, cultural and religious actors. The primary focus will be on moments of contact between these cultures, between 711 (the Muslim conquest of Iberia) and 1284 (the end of the reign of Alfonso X of Leon-Castile). We shall approach the period primarily through case studies of particular times, places and texts. One such case study is that of the so-called ‘spontaneous martyrs’ of Cordoba, a small group of ninth-century Christians who deliberately sought death at the hands of the Muslim authorities in al-Andalus; we shall use the martyrs to consider how processes of acculturation and assimilation affect social institutions, cultural belonging, and family life. The picture of monolithic clashing civilisations will be challenged and complicated throughout by attention to diversity and fluidity on both sides: ethnic and sectarian divisions among Muslims; the experiences of converts and the children of religiously-mixed marriages; and the mismatch between external and internal approaches to the conflict, in the shape of Frankish and North African incomers to Iberia.

As is usual for a 'special subject' module, we'll approach all this first and foremost through primary source texts, discussed in seminars. Particular attention will be paid to lawcodes, chronicles, and poetry for evidence of the theory and practice of relations between dominant and subordinate religious groups, in both al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) and the Christian kingdoms of the northern peninsula.",,,,,,"Seminars encourage independent study and promote improvements in oral communication, problem-solving skills and adaptability; they allow students to develop and test their own ideas, based on reading undertaken independently; they encourage students to discuss with each other, not just with the tutor. They are central to the special subject as an extended group project, in which staff and students discover and analyse primary sources collectively.","Submitted work tests intended knowledge and skills outcomes, and develops key skills in research, reading and writing.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Birth Control in the 19th & 20th Centuries,20,Professor Violetta Hionidou,"In England couples started consciously reducing the number of children they had from around 1870. In less than 100 years ALL couples were doing so. A similar transition occurred earlier in France and the USA. Why did such a transition occur in the nineteenth century for the first time? This module examines the availability of birth control methods (including abortion) as well as the knowledge and acceptance of the various methods by the people. We will explore the methods used by members of the different classes and the reasons for the wide variation between them. By 1918, the central issue for the middle classes, who had already achieved very low fertility, was centred on the husband-wife sexual relationship. We will be using the most popular sex manual as our main primary text, Married Love by Marie Stopes, and we will examine its impact in shaping expectations. We will also explore the role of eugenics in shaping much of the birth control discourse in the early part of the twentieth century. The various players such as medical doctors, the church and the state and their stance towards birth control will also be discussed. Last but not least, we will assess the importance of the pill and whether this was really responsible for the sexual revolution.

While the geographical  focus of the module is on Britain, we will also be drawing parallels with the experience of other European countries and the USA.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Jarrow Crusade,20,Dr Matt Perry,"The Jarrow Crusade is hailed as a defining moment in the ‘hungry thirties’. It was the protest of the people of a Tyneside town against the closure of their shipyard and the blocking of a new steelworks. More than any other protest it is held up as a model for others to follow. Its rejection of politics and its courting of respectable opinion are seen as the reason for its success; this is at least the version of events with which many will be familiar. Yet the Crusade did not secure jobs for Jarrow and a series of myths and folklore have come to surround the event. This course will attempt to delve beyond the myths to the real history of the Crusade and in so doing discover insights into the context of contemporaneous events and British society in the 1930s. In order to do so it will use a wide range of primary materials and cultural representations of the Crusade. It will also consider the implications for different types of history: labour history, the history of protest, public history, the heritage industry as well as the history of events.

•To examine the social and political history of the Jarrow Crusade, and to contextualise it in terms of the history of Britain in the 1930s.
•To identify and evaluate a range of relevant primary sources, contemporaneous literature.

In proportion to its size, it is argued that Northern Ireland is the most heavily researched area on earth, but what caused a war of this scale to break out in Ireland, and what perpetuated it for over 35 years, with a death toll of over 3,500 people? At the heart of the conflict are a tangle of interrelated questions. Who should govern Northern Ireland and what should the constitutional position be? How can social and economic inequalities, especially in the field of employment and housing, be remedied? How can the state accommodate religious and cultural differences relating to education, the Irish language and the broad spread of cultural expression? How can political disputes be conducted and resolved without resorting to violence? How can security and order be justly and inclusively administered in a deeply divided society? This module will study the political, religious, social and cultural history of the region since 1969 and, using primary source documents and oral histories, will investigate and dispel the myths that surround some of the debates. It will focus on the move towards conflict resolution on the island and in Britain, examining the roles of both the Dublin and London governments during the conflict and peace process.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Genocide and Justice in the Twentieth Century: From the Armenian Genocide to the International Criminal Court,20,Professor Daniel Siemens,"Mass atrocities and genocide have shaped the history of the twentieth century. The Armenian genocide in the middle of the First World War, the Holodomor and the Holocaust in the 1930s and 1940s, yet also more recent mass atrocities which occurred during the Bosnian War and in Rwanda in the 1990s have not only deeply affected millions of people in the respective regions, but have also captured the global public imagination – at the time of these events but also until much later. The scale of these crimes exceeded what people in previous centuries experienced and imagined and gave way to a new and deeply rooted pessimism that came to associate modernity no longer exclusively with progress (as in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries), but also with what is now believed to be the ‘dark side’ of modern civilisation. At the same time, however, did the international community begin to develop mechanism and institutions to enforce human rights on a global scale, to ‘make good’ for the surviving victims of genocide and to hold those responsible accountable. We are thus confronted with a highly ambivalent picture. Against this background, the aim of this module is threefold: to provide students with in-depth factual information about major genocides in the twentieth century, to make them understand how these crimes triggered the development of legal categories and institutions to deal with these events and ideally prevent them from happening in the future, and – finally – to make them aware how closely political, legal and historical studies are interwoven when analysing mass violence and genocide in the twentieth century.",,,,,,"As a special subject, aside from an in-depth understanding of the content of the module, the teaching methods, which focus on small group work, independent research and writing, relate to the core learning outcomes of supporting students in developing research skills across a wide range of sources, being able to synthesise the information they collect and form convincing and coherent arguments. 

Independent learning is essential to this module: students are expected to develop skills of source evaluation, critical reading and note-taking in an independent and effective manner. Seminar teaching complements these skills by allowing students the opportunity to share and debate information gathered independently. Oral skills of argument and presentation will be developed. Moreover, a significant part of seminar teaching will test the development of primary source analysis as well as of secondary sources from history and related disciplines, in particular law and politics.

Small group teaching will allow the students to explore ideas and patterns together in a structured way, and great emphasis will be placed on primary sources and their interpretation as well as historiography.

This module follows Mexico’s trajectory along a process of political, social, and cultural centralisation.  We begin with the messy aftermath of a revolution that exposed divisions between ethnic groups, social classes and family members.  We trace the political, socio-economic, and cultural measures taken by the State to consolidate its power and to persuade all Mexicans that they had a stake in the future.  We celebrate Mexico’s economic boom period (1940-50s) - a time of high living and rock ’n’ roll.  We consider why it all went wrong in the 1960s and ask whether one event, the massacre of students in 1968, marked a loss of post-revolutionary innocence.  We then look at the rise of civil society and the clamour for democracy that finally led, in 2000, to the end of the single-party State.  As we’ll see, throughout this peaceful yet turbulent period the image of Emiliano Zapata has been used and abused by different groups for different ends.  Dictatorships, icons, “Refried Elvis”, the summer of ’68, Zapatistas: they’re all here.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Viking-Age Scandinavia,20,Dr Scott Ashley,"The Vikings transformed the face of northern Europe in the early middle ages. Raiding and settlement in the British Isles, Normandy, Iceland, Greenland and North America created a culture and economy that stretched across the Atlantic Ocean five hundred years before Columbus. In the east, Swedish Rus traders and raiders sailed to Constantinople and exchanged furs and slaves for the silver of the Islamic world. But how were early medieval Scandinavians able to achieve such feats and what effects did they have on their homelands? 

This Special Subject allows you to explore the origins and course of the Viking-Age in Denmark, Norway and Sweden using a variety of written sources, including the Icelandic family and kings’ sagas, ancient Old Norse poetry and mysterious runic inscriptions. You will get the opportunity to examine in detail some of the key archaeological sites in Scandinavia, some only discovered in the last few years, including the trading-towns of Ribe, Kaupang and Birka, the great aristocratic complexes of Uppåkra and Tissø around the Baltic Sea, and Borg in Lofoten on the edge of the Arctic. You will also be able to delve into the everyday and inner lives of the Vikings, exploring their customs in life and death, their memories, heroes and religious beliefs, both heathen and Christian. This module will open a window for you onto a civilization that can be both profoundly alien and curiously familiar, but that is without doubt one of the most fascinating Europe has produced.

The module aims are to provide an opportunity to:
1) Engage with a series of challenging literary, material and visual sources and to develop an in-depth knowledge of a pivotal region in the history of early medieval Europe. 
2) Acquire a sound general knowledge of the subject, reading widely and critically in the primary and secondary literature associated with it and to develop the capacity for independent study.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Women in Colonial South Asia: Tradition, Reform and Modernity",20,Dr Samiksha Sehrawat,"Students who are interested in non-European history or in gender history will enjoy this module, which uses lectures, seminars and film screenings to discuss a very important aspect of Asian societies: gender discrimination. There is a strong tradition of gender discrimination in India with women often receiving poorer education, health care and being at the receiving end of different forms of violence. The Delhi rape case in 2012 has been in the news internationally but is unfortunately not an isolated occurrence. Indian women’s position has also been historically important for British rule in India.

Women were at the heart of debates about ‘traditional’ Indian society and efforts to reform and modernize it. British rule over south Asia was justified in terms of the low position of women in Indian society and the colonial state intervened through new laws to act as saviours of Indian womanhood. British Rule in India was known for the banning of Sati in the early nineteenth century. Sati was the practice of burning widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands and was believed by missionaries to signify the low position of women in Indian society. Laws were passed by the British colonial government to prohibit Sati or widow-immolation and to prevent child-marriage. This course will examine the debates that this created regarding women in South Asian society. Upper-class and upper-caste male reformers debated with the British the grounds on which reform would proceed. Attempts by missionaries to use these issues to encourage conversion to Christianity and the colonial state’s intervention were perceived by the orthodox as an attack on Indian society. 

This module will examine the issues that arose in these debates through an examination of themes such as widow-remarriage, women’s education, purdah (practices of veiling women) and what it meant to be a good wife and mother. The course will discuss whether women’s participation in the anti-colonial nationalist movement was based on the understanding that women were the repositories of Indian ‘tradition’. It will ask what light women’s writing throws on their position in these debates and issues. 

As this is a special subject, there will be extensive use of primary sources to reconstruct the viewpoints of different historical actors, including British colonial administrators, missionaries, South Asian male reformers, Hindu and Muslim women and British women.

The aims of the module are:
1) To understand how the position of women in India became a subject of both colonial and nationalist discourses and explore the role that gender can play in fashioning identities.
2) To provide an opportunity to acquire a sound general knowledge of the subject, reading widely and critically in the primary and secondary literature associated with it and to develop the capacity for independent study. 
3) To provide an opportunity to investigate in some depth selected problems in South Asian history, including the appraisal of selected source material and the critical examination of current historiography.",,,,,,"Seminars encourage independent study and promote improvements in oral communication, problem-solving skills and adaptability.

This implies a shift from a circular conception of time to a linear one. Looking forward to the future, the idea of progress is currently in crisis not least due to pessimistic diagnosis of global warming. It is useful to think about the history of the future, its intellectual genesis in the Early Modern period (16th to 18th century) and what the future has meant for European cultures in the 19th and 20th century in order to understand current cultural developments.

It has been claimed that the modern Islamist agenda traces its roots to pre-modern radical theologians such as Ahmad Ibn Taymiyya and Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Yet, to what extent was Islamist ideology in the 20th Century conditioned by the transformative impact of Western colonial modernity? To what extent can the Islamist notions of thinkers such as Hasan al-Banna, Mawlana Mawdudi and Sayyid Qutb be compared with these of the other ideological movements of the 20th century, such as fascism, Marxism-Leninism and nationalism? How important is it to recognize the specifically colonial origins of Islamism?

Aims: 
-        To familiarise students with critical debates concerning the historic origins of Islamists ideology
-        To enable students to engage with these debates through analysis of texts written by prominent Islamists
-        To provide a broad awareness of the cultural, economic and political contexts in which Islamism emerged",,,,,,The core textbook will provide a beginning point for the guided independent study which should facilitate further discussion by providing important contextual knowledge and familiarising students with critical debates surrounding the ideological origins of Islamism.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Europe and the Ottoman Empire, 1453-1798",20,Dr Simon Mills,"The early modern period is often defined as the age in which Europeans explored and colonised the New World, and by the ‘shock of discovery’ resulting from the European encounter with the peoples and the civilisations of the American continents. Yet the geopolitics of recent decades, from Western military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the unfolding of the ‘Arab spring’, to debates over the role of Islam in Europe and North America, have increasingly led historians to turn their attention to the ongoing relationship between Europe and the Islamic world during the period between the fall of Byzantine Constantinople and the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt.

In this module, we shall dig beneath overly simplistic accounts of Western representations of an ‘Oriental’ East and clichéd notions of a ‘clash of civilizations’ to discover some of the myriad connections which linked Europe and the Ottoman Empire throughout this period. We shall explore some of the institutions – mercantile, diplomatic, ecclesiastical, and scholarly – which transcended the boundaries between Christian Europe and the lands of Islam; and we shall encounter the lives and the often fascinating careers of the various individuals who moved between these worlds: from Barbary corsairs to Eastern Christian travellers; from Flemish diplomats to Jesuit missionaries.

Through these keyholes, we shall begin to catch sight of the flows of people, objects, and ideas between early modern Europe and the Ottoman Empire. We shall uncover how these interactions were played out in the port cities of Europe and the Middle East, and we shall learn to ask unexpected questions about these encounters: how did an Icelandic Lutheran minister end up as a slave on the North-African coast? How did Arabic books come to be printed in the Netherlands? And how did Luther come to write a preface to the Qur'an? This will lead us, in turn, to rethink some of the broader narratives of early modern European history, and indeed to question whether ‘Europe’ and ‘the Ottoman Empire’ can meaningfully be separated, or whether, as some historians have tried to do, we ought to look instead for new models of a more integrated historiography.

Through a selection of weekly readings focused on primary sources, we shall survey a range of approaches to understanding the early modern period. These will include the more traditional methods of political and diplomatic history, as well as recent historians' attempts to describe processes of intellectual and cultural exchange and to analyze the significance of cross-cultural encounters. We shall question the relative advantages and disadvantages of these different methodologies: what, for example, are the benefits of the continuing urge to construct meta-narratives of Mediterranean history against the recent turn to biographical and ‘microhistorical’ approaches? How might the concept of an early modern ‘republic of letters’ be extended to include areas outside Europe? And how might a focus on the material aspects of the past provide further insight into the connections between Europe and the Ottoman Empire?",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce topics and provide expert orientation and exposition on a broad range of themes and issues (see 'Outline of Syllabus'), supplemented by the module reading list. 

Seminars will provide students with the opportunity to practise the evaluation and interpretation of primary sources, and to think about how these sources can be integrated into broader historiographical arguments. The seminars will also be an opportunity to improve students’ skills in oral presentation, both through pre-prepared presentations, and through group discussion. Seminars will be student-led and facilitated by the module leader, and will hinge upon group discussion and debate about materials circulated in advance (primary sources and secondary 'core readings'). In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced, there is the capacity to hold live seminar discussions online and retain timetabled slots.

Structured guided learning will be at the core of the module. Students will be expected to devote the bulk of their time to reading – primary sources, the weekly ‘core readings’, and wider reading, using the reading lists in the module guide as a starting point. The seminars will provide further opportunities to reflect back on this independent study, discussing issues which arise, and deepening an understanding of the relevant historiographical debates.","The review essay (40%) will test the student’s ability to engage critically and deeply with the work of a practising historian, analyzing the use of primary source material and developing a sophisticated understanding of and response to the argument in relation to other relevant secondary literature and broader historiographical questions, and to write lucidly and confidently to a high standard.

The source commentary (Formative) will provide the student with an opportunity to practise the analysis of a primary source, consolidating preparatory work for the seminars, and developing skills required for the research essay.  

The research essay (60%) is a response to a question from a pre-set list (although students will also be given the option to formulate their own questions in consultation with the module leader). It is intended to bring together the balance of knowledge and skills developed over the course of the module. It is an opportunity for students to apply their learning on an individual and independent basis, and will assess the student's ability both to analyse relevant primary source materials, and to integrate this analysis into a focused and clearly-expounded argument. In these respects, the research essay builds on the earlier assessment components.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Punishing the Criminal Dead: Crime, Culture, and Corpses in Modern Britain",20,Dr Shane McCorristine,"Histories of crime and criminals traditionally stop after execution. This ignores a range of sources and debates looking at where criminal corpses went if they were denied burial as a further punishment. This module looks at the history of post-mortem punishment in Britain, c.1752-1900, focusing on the journeys of the bodies of convicted criminals from courtrooms, to scaffolds, and then (after death) on to hospitals, dissection rooms, museums, and private collections. Starting with the Murder Act of 1752, we will examine how the notorious bodies and body parts of the criminal dead became part of a disturbing and frequently illegal corpse trade that drew together the judiciary, executioners, medical professionals, and workhouse officials. This subject matters because it continues to inform the modern organ/corpse trade as well as the ethics of using corpses for medical knowledge/experimentation. Students will be asked to frame these practices in the context of Elias’s “civilising process” thesis. This module will place an emphasis on the wide and rich variety of primary sources about the criminal dead, including court records, folklore and superstition, images, ballads, and material/medical collections.",,,,,,"As a special subject, aside from an in-depth understanding of the content of the module, the teaching methods, which focus on small group work, independent research and writing, relate to the core learning outcomes of supporting students in developing research skills across a wide range of sources, being able to synthesise the information they collect and form convincing and coherent arguments.

This module will also contain module talks, giving students a detailed introduction to the Handbook and the aims of the module, helping them to be clear about the tasks, sources, and skills they can work on. The workshop will give us a chance to sit down with archival documents for a period and devise ways to bring them to life, contextualise them, and record link. These are key skills that will help deepen our engagement with this subject matter. There will be two drop-in hours also, which will assist students in their essay plans, accessing reading, discussing intellectual problems or providing other module-related support.","The case study will provide students with an opportunity to work in-depth on a particular criminal/execution, introducing them to relevant documents, sources, and approaches. 

The essay will test ability to research, develop, and communicate an argument about a particular subject. This calls for both general knowledge and a detailed understanding of sources relating to the course topics.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Russian Cities and Culture from Peter the Great to the Revolution,20,Professor Stella Ghervas,"This module is an invitation to visit key Russian cities through their history and culture, from Peter the Great to the Bolshevik Revolution. We will make extended stays in the two Russian capitals, Moscow and St. Petersburg; in Kiev, the capital of the ancient Rus and today’s Ukraine; in the new city of Odessa on the Black Sea; in the provincial city of Nizhny Novgorod; and in the two merchant cities of Kazan and Rostov-on-Don. During our journey, we will ask a number of questions: How were these cities created? Why did they evolve in the way they did, sometimes dramatically? What types of populations lived there and what were their cultural expressions? To answer these questions, we will examine critically a variety of primary sources written by those who planned, ruled and lived in these cities, by foreigners who visited them and by authors who re-imagined their life and history in literature.

The module goals are:
1.        To provide historical and geographical background on the varied urban realities of Russia, as well as to show commonalities and comparisons with other European cities.
2.        To impart the methods of historical research on cities and an insight on the range of themes that this research subject may cover, within and beyond Russia.
3.        To introduce students to handling translated primary sources on the history of Russian cities.
4.        To encourage students to read widely and critically in the secondary literature, and to develop their capacity for independent study.
5.        To enable students to focus on specific issues of interest and develop their own interpretations of sources.
6.        To encourage students to think about their own communities and how they have developed over time.",,,,,,"Small-group teaching provides students with an opportunity to summarize and ask questions about the readings, and to improve their ability to engage in debate and discussion.","The extended essay will test the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of the history of Russian cities and culture. It will assess the general knowledge of history and historiography the student has gained throughout the course of the module, as well as the detailed knowledge of particular primary sources, and the student’s ability to draw on these to construct a focused and clearly-expounded argument under the constraints of time.

The ability to present ideas clearly and convincingly in oral form will be tested by (non-assessed) pre-prepared presentations in the seminars, and through ongoing group discussion.

The form of the resit is no different from the above, i.e. no marks are carried over from the sit to the resit. Students are not allowed to submit for the resit any work that they have previously submitted.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Lunatic to Citizen? Madness and Society since 1900,20,Dr Vicky Long,"This module studies social responses to mental disorder in Britain over a period which saw the polarisation of sanity and madness give way to a belief that mental health and illness formed a continuum, culminating in the creation of community mental health services and the closure of psychiatric hospitals. Throughout the module, students will study different primary source materials which can be used to research the history of mental disorder and will explore the divergent interpretations advanced by different historians to account for the ways in which society - and the medical profession - has responded to mental disorder. The module adopts a thematic approach, focusing each week on a particular topic, such as treatment methods, patient perspectives, the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s and community care. Students will be expected to read the assigned secondary texts in preparation for the seminars, and will critically engage with primary materials pertinent to their studies. The project component encourages students to apply historical knowledge to contemporary needs, thereby identifying the ongoing contemporary relevance of the historical issues covered over the module.",,,,,,"The delivery of this stage 3 module is designed to foster student-led, engaged learning. At its heart lies a weekly 2 hour seminar. The seminars will focus upon students’ discussion of texts, debates, sources and approaches. By asking students to engage with readings which advance divergent and contradictory arguments, the module will encourage students to engage with the contested nature of historical knowledge. Dovetailing with the seminars, online asynchronous structured learning activities will introduce students to a range of different primary source materials, linked to each week's seminar topic, and will encourage students to critically engage with and analyse different source types, enriching seminar discussion.

The module is divided into four thematic blocks, and each block will be introduced by a one hour lecture that places developments in a wider context, and draws connections. Two workshops will help prepare students for the essay assignment and the project assignment, combining advice from the lecturer, practical exercises, and an opportunity for Q&A. Drop-in slots will enable students to seek individualised support on their assignments, and to raise questions about the course and its contents. Two short lectures created by the module leader will provide students with an overview of the module and an introduction to the subject, and an introduction to the project assignment; these are online resources, enabling students to access these throughout the module.

The course entails three forms of guided independent study: preparatory readings for seminars; independent research for the project assignment, which asks students to apply historical knowledge to contemporary dilemmas; and time allocated to complete coursework.","The essay (summative assessment 1) assesses students’ knowledge of the history of mental disorder, of debates in the field, and of theoretical and conceptual approaches applied to studying this topic. It also tests students’ abilities to structure their argument, write clearly, and follow presentation guidelines.

The project component requires students to apply their research skills in a real world context by producing an output for an external body (e.g. a poster, short article or letter) which applies knowledge of the history of mental health to address contemporary issues and debates. I will circulate a short form to students asking them to identify which organisation or individual they propose to target, what message they aim to convey, how this message is informed by historical knowledge, and what format they plan to adopt for their output (the formative assessment); this directs students' attention to the learning outcomes for this assessment, and allows me to offer suggestions and advice. 

Students are encouraged to exploit the wealth of readily-available digitised primary source materials available for this topic, which are signposted throughout the module, in their project. The project is submitted alongside a reflective report (summative assessment 2) which enables the student to articulate their rationale for the project and how it is underpinned by historical knowledge in more detail

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","The Rise and Fall of the Berlin Wall, 1961 - 1990",20,Dr Felix Schulz,"‘If you do not like it here. Piss off, and go over there!’ This was the shorthand slogan often employed after 1949 against those who complained in West Germany. But more than of a latent conservatism the phrase is symptomatic for the fact that both Germanies had to live with the fact that they could not escape from each other, nor could they ignore the physical scar that was running through Berlin, the rest of the country, and in fact the whole continent after 1961. The Berlin Wall is, thus, emblematic for a whole era in German, European and International history: the cold war. This special subject will explore both the wider and specific history of the Berlin Wall and with it the histories of the two German States from the construction of the wall to the eventual downfall.

The module aims to: 
1) Examine the political, social, and cultural history of the GDR and FRG after the physical division of the two German States in 1961, and to locate it in the context of modern German history.
2) Identify a range of primary sources and contemporary publications.
3) Examine and evaluate a range of historiographical perspectives.
4) Provide an opportunity to acquire a sound general knowledge of the subject, reading widely and critically in the primary and secondary literature associated with it and to develop the capacity for independent study.
5) Provide an opportunity of investigating in some depth selected problems including the appraisal of selected source material and the critical examination of current historiography.",,,,,,"Seminars are designed to encourage independent study and promote improvements in oral communication, team work, problem-solving skills and adaptability.","The 2000 word essay tests a clear general knowledge of the subject plus the ability to think and analyse a problem quickly, to select from and to apply both the general knowledge and detailed knowledge of aspects of the subject to new questions, problem-solving skills, adaptability, the ability to work unaided and to write clearly and concisely.

Documentary commentary exercises and examinations test knowledge and understanding of the texts set for the module.  The ability to compare and contrast related source texts on a common subject.  The ability to expound and criticize a textual extract lucidly, succinctly and with relevance in a relatively brief space.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","The Rising Generation: Youth, Age and Protest in Cold War Britain",20,Dr Laura Tisdall,"This module considers how both conservatives and radicals used the language of age and life-stage to construct visions of the future between 1960 and 1989. How far can protest movements - second-wave feminism, black civil rights, gay liberation and CND - be understood as generational conflicts? And how does employing age, gender, class, race and sexuality as categories of historical analysis change the way that we do history?

This module aims to introduce students to important empirical and methodological questions about age, gender and sexuality, using a case study of Cold War Britain. It will consider the histories of 'muted groups' such as children, women, people of colour and LGBT people, but also demonstrate how the language used about such groups is used to structure power relations in society; for example, how groups and individuals are demeaned by being told 'that's childish' or 'you're acting like a girl'. The module will draw on a wide range of primary sources - for example, periodicals, photographs, maps, oral histories and self-narratives - and will be situated in the relevant historiography on post-war and Cold War Britain.

Particular attention will be paid to the following objectives:

•        How to use oral history and self-narrative sources.
•        How to use ‘secondary’ historiography when the main histories of a movement are written by contemporaries e.g. the historiography of second-wave feminism.
•        How to handle conflicting narratives about race, gender, sexuality and age critically, and how to use historical empathy to assess these sources.
•        How to analyse histories of particular phenomena using race, gender, age and sexuality as categories of historical analysis.",,,,,,"The large % of independent study promotes self-directed learning and the effective use of primary and secondary literature. PIP seminar teaching encourages the close analysis of primary source material and the development of critical thinking and historical empathy. Online asynchronous discussions allow students to participate in class in a different way if they are less confident in PIP seminars. Recorded lecture materials provide scaffolding for student learning while preserving time in seminars for student discussion and analysis of primary sources and set reading, ensuring all students have a basic understanding of the topic and can participate in discussion.","This source-led course privileges close reading of the source material rather than memorisation for a timed examination. Therefore, the main assessments are coursework-based. This will allow the assessment of the intended knowledge outcomes by testing the students' understanding of the primary and secondary literature, and their ability to examine this literature critically and to situate their own argument within this existing work. Formative assessment, in the form of oral presentations, will allow students to develop their confidence both in public speaking and in posing questions to other students, skills which are important for the job market as well as for personal development

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Consuming Empire: Global Trade and the Transformation of Britain, c. 1688-1820.",20,Dr David Hope,"This module explores how global trade and colonialism transformed British material culture during the eighteenth century. By 1800, expanding overseas trade and empire had made Britain a major world power. Critical to this ascendancy were British consumers desire for new ‘luxuries’, commodities that included Chinese silk, tea and porcelain, Indian cotton textiles, Caribbean sugar, Mocha and West Indian coffee, Virginian tobacco, and North American furs. The influx of these goods profoundly changed the dress, diet, and homes of eighteenth-century Britons, influenced gendered notions of consumption, and gave rise to new forms of sociability. At the forefront of this expanding ‘world of goods’ was an emergent ‘middling sort’ that profited from increased commercialisation and facilitated the distribution of these commodities through a growing network of rural and urban shops. The superior artistry of imported ‘goods from the East’ inspired the creation of new, innovative British manufactures that utilised colonial raw materials produced by Indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans.

The emergence of a consumer society in eighteenth-century Britain was inseparable from colonialism and environmental exploitation and its legacy profoundly shaped the modern world. The production, trade, and consumption of new ‘luxury’ commodities brought diverse peoples and cultures across the globe into ever closer contact and was a key stage in the creation of a globalised economy. By reflecting on the historical roots of this phenomenon, the module explores issues that are of vital relevance to the present day. The module includes an opportunity to directly engage with the material culture of eighteenth-century Britain via a fieldtrip to either the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh or Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle.

Through engagement with social, economic, cultural, imperial, and environmental history, the module enables students to acquire a detailed knowledge of the material transformations in British society during the eighteenth century and how these changes were connected to global trade and colonialism. Further aims include:

- Develop confidence in the ability to interpret quantitative data, material objects, and other primary source material that historians use to critically assess the consumption of goods in past societies. 
- Raise capacity for independent thinking by requiring students to find a material object to comment on, and through offering students the opportunity to create and answer their own research question (with guidance). 
- Introduce students to key historical interpretations relating to the rise of a consumer society and provide reflections on the colonial and environmental legacies of this phenomenon.",,,,,,"The combination of lectures, seminars, and fieldwork is designed to encourage an active and student-led approach to learning. Lectures provide a foundational knowledge of core themes and are active learning experiences that use technology enhanced learning to provide instant feedback on students’ progress. 

Seminars provide students with the skills to analyse and locate primary sources used by historians to interpret the consumption of goods in past societies and allows for the discussion of relevant historiographical interpretations, encourages independent study, and promotes improvement in oral presentation, interpersonal communication, problem-solving skills, and adaptability. Preparation for seminars requires students to read and critically analyse a wide range of primary sources and secondary literature: a programme of private reading that requires good time management and personal responsibility for learning. 

The fieldtrip provides students with the opportunity to physically study material objects and supports their preparation of the object commentary. Lectures, seminars, and the fieldtrip support students’ ability to interpret quantitative data and material objects.

In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced, there is the capacity to hold live seminar discussions online and retain timetabled slots.","The object commentary assesses students’ ability to critically analyse and contextualise a primary source and to situate it within relevant historiographical debates. It requires students to write concisely and since students choose their own object to comment on, the commentary encourages participants to think independently. The multiple-choice test (formative assessment) supports the development of competency in handling and interpreting quantitative data contained in primary sources, tables, and figures. For each question, an image of a graph, table, or primary source will be displayed, and students are asked to read a specific bit of information from the displayed image and select the correct answer from a choice of four options. This provides scaffolding for the summative research essay in which students are expected to engage with this type of evidence. The research essay evaluates the acquisition of a clear general knowledge of the subject, as well as the ability to locate and synthesise relevant information and express complex ideas in written form using appropriate scholarly sources. The essay assesses students’ capacity to interpret material objects and quantitative data, and their ability to use such evidence to construct a compelling argument. Students have the freedom to set their own research question for the essay (with guidance), which further assists their proficiency to work independently and increases their investment in the module. Work submitted during the delivery of the module forms a means of determining student progress. All submitted work tests intended knowledge and skills outcomes and develops key skills in research, reading, and writing.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Health and disease in the Anthropocene: Intersections of human and environmental health post 1800 (Inactive),20,Dr Clare Hickman,"Human health has always been interlinked with that of the environment and as the Anthropocene (our current geological age) progresses, this is becoming an increasingly urgent matter for public health policy. This module will look at key ways in which humans have adapted their environment in the past, in relation to their own concerns regarding health and disease. Through a series of key case studies over time and place such as an investigation of attempts to control air pollution in the late nineteenth century, the mid-twentieth century and today, students will gain an understanding of the historical and cultural contexts of such debates and the interrelationships between human and environmental health. They will also gain an understanding of how people in the past conceived the relationship between different environments and health and how that has changed over time. Although focused on Britain, the module will consider transnational and global contexts in relation to the use of forests for the treatment of Tuberculosis in Germany and Australia as well as the development of strategies to deal with malaria in India, the US and East Africa. 

This module aims:
• To introduce students to historical research and to guide them in the analysis of primary documents and texts.
• To provide an opportunity to acquire a sound general knowledge of the subject, reading widely and critically in the primary and secondary literature associated with it and to develop the capacity for independent study.
• To enable students to develop an understanding of the interconnections between concepts of human health and disease and environmental health over the past two centuries.",,,,,,"Discussion of the key debates in the shifting understanding of human and environmental health will take place in online synchronous seminar blocks. Alongside these sessions, there will be asynchronous materials and structured learning to engage students in developing their approaches to primary source analysis and to develop their skills in critical thinking and close reading of texts. There will also be workshops to develop communication skills to allow students to produce a creative piece (short podcast, blog, poster etc) which aims to encourage a public audience to place current debates around climate change, air pollution, malaria etc in their historic context.

Seminar discussions require students to articulate and respond to ideas and questions, as well as develop further the knowledge and understanding acquired through set reading.
The investigation of a wide range of source material and scholarship guides students in exploring and comparing these resources, developing skills in applying key concepts and ideas in the historiography of the Mediterranean.","Submitted Work tests knowledge outcomes and develops skills in research, reading and writing. The assessments require students to draw on the broad knowledge of Mediterranean history they have acquired in the course of the module.

The Formative assessment written exercise tests students' ability to select and organise materials for a piece of extended writing, practicing skills in time and project management.

The 2,500 word primary-source based thematic essay tests students’ ability to conduct independent research, relate primary source documents to each other, formulate an interpretation of evidence, and write in clear academic language. 

Primary source analyses test students' ability to engage closely with primary sources, assessing issues such as authorship, genre, context, style, and usefulness to the historian. This develops the ability to expound and critique a text lucidly in relation to a specific theme or aspect of Mediterranean history.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","The Renaissance World of Machiavelli, 1450-1550",20,Dr Katie East,"This Special Subject uses the works of one of the greatest minds in the history of political thought, Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527), to explore the political, intellectual, and cultural world of Renaissance Florence. Through the lens of Machiavelli’s political tracts, scholarship, plays, letters, and diplomatic texts, we will discover how various political, religious, and social issues informed his position, shaping the radical view he took of the world, a view which had an immense and lasting influence throughout Europe. We will encounter key figures of the period, such as Cesare Borgia, Caterina Sforza, Pope Alexander VI, Girolamo Savonarola, and members of the Medici family, and we will examine the tensions at work in Italy at this time, between city states and the Papacy, and with respect to external threats from France and the Holy Roman Empire. Florentine culture during the Renaissance will also be studied, particularly the importance of humanism, the arrival of print, the role of the genders, and the occupation with questions of morality.

Students will engage with a rich and active historiographical tradition, in which debates concerning the character of Machiavelli, his aims and beliefs, and his ultimate importance, will be confronted different approaches which instead of placing Machiavelli from front and centre broaden that focus to consider the world within which he moved. Students will also engage with a diverse array of sources, encompassing not only Machiavelli’s written works of numerous genres, but also works by his contemporaries, examples of print and scholarship, and images drawn from the rich offerings of Renaissance Florence.",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce topics with key debates and themes. Seminars encourage independent learning, discussion, and debate, while also guiding students on how to approach primary sources and historiography in a critical and effective manner.","The shorter written exercise will take place during the semester, and will focus on analysis of sources, allowing both the accumulation of understanding and a tool for tracking and informing student progress.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Conflict and Consensus in Early Modern European Political Thought (Inactive),20,Dr Nicholas Mithen,"This module takes a long view at a theme in the making of modern political thought in Europe between 1500 and 1800: conflict and consensus in social and political thought. Between the Italian Wars (1494) and the French Revolution (1789), European thinkers grappled with the crisis of traditional frameworks for governing political life. In response, they invented new ideas, institutions and cultures designed to safeguard political stability and to promote individual liberty and the common good. At the core of their political thought was the relationship between conflict and consensus within political societies. 

In this module, over eleven weeks we look at nine different manifestations of this relationship in some of the most important thinkers in the evolution of Western political thought, stretching from Niccolò Machiavelli to Edmund Burke. By locating their political thought in its historical context, we also interrogate some of the key intellectual and political developments of early modern Europe. This module also introduces, alongside conflict and consensus, other key concepts in political thought, such as the state, republicanism, despotism and liberalism.

Students will come away with an enhanced understanding of the evolution of political thought in early modern Europe and a new perspective on early modern European history, as well as a grasp of the concepts and language central to understanding political thought. They will also develop skills in close-reading of complex texts, engagement with intellectual-historical sources, and the ability to discuss and present complicated ideas in a group scenario.",,,,,,"This module is primarily based on reading published historical texts in context. This is reflected in the division of teaching components into lectures and seminars: the weekly 1 hour lectures, delivered non-synchronously, will give the students an overview of the historical context of the text looked at each week; the synchronous seminar, delivered in person on campus, will then primarily look at a specific historical text, of which students will be expected to have read key passages, as directed by the instructor. Student engagement in both lectures and seminars will be further facilitated by the distribution of key secondary readings, either articles or extracts from books, and they will also be encouraged to pursue independent study on the themes and thinkers.

Seminars will ideally be student-led, and it is anticipated that this will be increasingly the case in the second half of the module. The instructor will stimulate and guide discussion, and ensure key learning objectives are met each week.

In the event that seminars are required to be delivered remotely, the seminar will be conducted through live discussions online, supported by a pre-recorded mini-lecture covering core themes, which students will watch in advance. As it is anticipated that this level 3 module will have only a small group of students, this model of remote delivery is expected to work well.","Formative Assessment

Reflective Log - Students will be required to write 2x300 word blog entries on the extent to which they have met learning objectives in the first three weeks. This will demonstrate the extent of their understanding and their level of writing. It will also allow them to reflect upon their progress, and enable the instructor to offer continuous feedback.

Assessment

Written exercise (25%) - students will be required to write a 750 word commentary on one of the texts looked at in weeks 2-6 (distinct from the week in which they give their oral presentation). This will demonstrate their ability to understand, interpret and present complex political-historical ideas, as well as to assess the quality of their written work. It will provide the instructor with the opportunity to give feedback in advance of their final assessment

Essay (75%) - students will be required to submit a 2,500 word essay, with the essay title chosen from a set list determined by the instructor. Each question will focus on one, or possibly a comparison between two, books and thinkers looked at in the course. Students will be required to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding, as well as to situate the thinker and book within the broader context of the themes looked at over the course of the module. This builds upon the skills and knowledge base, as well as writing practice, developed in the other assessments.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Unfree Nation: Enslavement in the United States from the Colonial Era to Reconstruction,20,Professor Susan-Mary Grant,"This modules explores, via primary documents and secondary analyses, the development, entrenchment, and eventual termination of enslavement in the United States of America, from the colonial era to the end of Reconstruction and the abolition of African American enslavement via the Thirteenth Amendment. 

It seeks to locate the history of African American enslavement within a broader history of the United States, and this will include the history of indigenous enslavement. Students will be encouraged to use first-hand testimonies of the enslaved, along with the arguments of the enslavers, to assess the broader impact of enslavement upon the minds and bodies of the enslaved, and the nation as a whole in respect of enslavement's immediate impact and its long-term legacy. 

The module will be taught via a combination of the traditional Special Subject seminar (two hour) and a series of online background asynchronous lectures to place the material in context. 

The focus of the module will be on the enslaved experience broadly conceived. It may include such topics as:

the enslavers’ perspectives
the enslaved community
indigenous enslavement
the role of mothers and fathers in sustaining a form of normality for the enslaved
the ‘soul death’ that enslavement produced across the enslaved population of the South 
the slave markets, running away, and the ways in which, once Civil War had broken out in 1861, the enslaved seized the opportunity to force the institution’s termination through their own actions. 
The tragedy of the refugee camps during the war, and the racism that the enslaved experienced from some in the Union army
The gradual withdrawal of Federal support for the formerly enslaved

All of these are designed to introduce students to a new way of looking at a subject, and at evidence, that is often very popular but for all the wrong reasons.",,,,,,"The teaching methods deployed in this module have been designed so as to match the learning outcomes and prepare students for the tripartite assessment structure. They comprise:

•        First and most obviously, reading. But there is so much potential secondary reading on this topic, more than any other in American history, that specific teaching skills have to be brought into play in order to help the student navigate what could be an unwieldy pile of books and articles. So the background (asynchronous) lectures will include guidance on the broad historiographical landscape up to now; the seminars (two-hour) will devote about 50% of their time to discussion and critique of secondary material, its approach, its sources, the appropriateness of both to the arguments etc. (this being one of the most contentious aspects of the study of enslavement in America).
•        Seminars will also introduce students to the use and analysis of primary material, including: appropriate sampling methods; the use of available online databases on, for example, slave runaway adverts, or the origins of slave shipping etc.
•        The broader seminar discussion and formative assessment, which will include presentations by the students themselves. This will require a degree of independent research into some of the online primary evidence, such as the WPA Slave Narratives, in order to test the extent to which students are acquiring the necessary research skills to interrogate material that is, in its nature, both dramatic and disturbing, and reach appropriate and considered conclusions about it.
•        The seminar discussions will also allow students to test out ideas, and share information they have gleaned from both primary and secondary material.
•        Finally, the cumulative effect of the teaching methods will give the students the confidence, by the module’s end, to discuss the fraught yet fascinating subject of enslavement and its legacy in an objective and considered manner, deploying evidence not just emotion, in making a case (for whatever essay topic they select to do).","•        The tripartite assessment structure is specifically designed to test each of the main three elements being taught in this module: independent research and analysis; historiographical assessment; and the ability to cogently and concisely argue a case.
•        Primary and secondary source analysis and commentary, together with the essay, tests knowledge and understanding of the texts set for the module and the primary material that is its focus. 
•        The ability to compare and contrast related source texts on a common subject. 
•        The ability to expound and criticize a text lucidly, succinctly and with relevance in a relatively brief word limit.
•        Formative assessment mid-module forms a means of determining student progress.
•        Submitted work, tests, intended knowledge and skills outcomes develops key skills in research, reading and writing.
•        No restrictions apply to study-abroad, exchange and Loyola students, but they are required to finish their assessment while in Newcastle as it is a Semester 1 module.

Study-abroad, non-Erasmus exchange and Loyola students spending semester 1 only are required to finish their assessment while in Newcastle.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","The Gulag: A History of the Soviet Camps - Origins, Experiences and Aftermaths",20,Dr Robert Dale,"This module seeks to explore the social, economic, political and cultural history of the Soviet camp system, known as the Gulag.  The module examines the history of the Soviet penal system from its inception in the early 1920s, through to the final dismantling of the Stalinist-era camps under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev in 1960. Yet it also examines the antecedents and precedents for the Soviet camps in the Tsarist system of Siberian exile, as well as the long afterlife of the Gulag in Soviet and post-Soviet culture, and individual and collective memories.  The Gulag played a central role in the Soviet Union, especially under the Stalinist dictatorship. Yet thanks to a wave of recent scholarship, historians are only just beginning to appreciate the complexity and diversity of the camp system, the range of different camp regimes, experiences of different categories of prisoners.  The Gulag imprisoned men, women, and children, and prisoners of different nationalities, ethnicities, religions, and social and cultural backgrounds.  The module, therefore, seeks to examine how the Gulag was established, the evolution of the camp system under Stalin and after, and the multiple entanglements and inter-relationship between the Soviet penal system, and wider society.  At its core is an attempt to explore the different forms Gulag regimes took in different places, the differing experiences of different groups of prisoners, and how these changed over time.  Furthermore, it will explore ongoing historiographical debates about the functions, purpose, and objectives of the Gulag, and their contribution to the wider Soviet project. In addition, the module will examine the impact of the Gulag upon its prisoners, survivors, and wider Soviet society. The Gulag shaped Soviet environments, landscapes, contributed to industrialisation and urbanisation. The seminars will explore the wide, vibrant and expanding scholarship of the Gulag, especially recent case studies which reveal the histories of individual camps, or specific groups of prisoners. These will also be supporting by an examination of the rich variety of primary source material available in English for studying the Gulag system, including official documents generated by the Gulag administration, camp memoirs, camp literature, and other documents generated by the vast camp network and its millions of prisoners.  

The module aims are: 
1) For students to have a detailed knowledge and understanding of the history of the Soviet camp system and its antecedents in the Tsarist penal system, from the establishment of the first Soviet concentration camps in the early 1920s, through to the dismantling of the Gulag in the late 1950s, and early 1960s.  
2) For students to have an in depth understanding of the historiographical debates surrounding the Gulag system, particularly the different forms Gulag camps took, their different functions and contribution to the Soviet economy and wider project, as well as scholarly discussions behind the purposes behind the Soviet camps. 
3) For students to consider the vast range of experiences of different groups of Gulag prisoners and how these varied over time, and between camp regimes. In addition, to consider the experiences of camp guards and administrations. 

4) For students to conduct research using primary sources (including official documents produced by the camp administration, camp literature, Gulag memoirs, diaries, and letters) and to bring that primary research to bear on historiographical debates. 
5) To improve students' skills in analysing and interpreting a range of Soviet primary sources from across the period relating to the Gulag system, and the wider Soviet project.",,,,,,"Seminars are designed to encourage students to engage directly with a wide range of primary and secondary source materials, and to raise and discuss the issues that are explored in the historiography of the topic under consideration that week. Seminars give students the opportunity to actively engage with these debates, and to interrogate source materials for themselves. Seminars are intended to be student-led and facilitated by the module leader, and will hinge upon smaller and larger group discussions in response to questions and source materials circulated in advance. A range of different activities centred around primary source materials, and examinations of the historiography will be the focus of seminars.   Seminars are an important forum for students to develop their own ideas and arguments in the light of wider discussion.  

In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced (especially in response to the public health situation) there is the capacity to hold live seminar discussions online and retain timetabled slots. 

Lectures in this module are intended to support and augment the seminar discussions, by introducing students to particularly important debates, providing scaffolded information and context, or focusing on particular forms of primary source material, specific documents, or case studies.  They will provide the necessary scaffolding to support student learning, and to complement seminar discussions. Lectures will help students to read, interpret and work with a variety of different forms of Soviet primary documents, many of which will be unfamiliar. Some parts of lectures will also explain and provide advice and support about how to prepare for pieces assessment, and how to use primary documents in both documentary commentaries and essays. Lectures then are intended to aligned with seminar topics, and offer guidance in how to examine particular forms of evidence. 

In the event that on-campus sessions need to be reduced, there is the capacity to present recorded lecture materials asynchronously. 

There will also be opportunity for surgery/drop in time to support work on assessments in Office Hour (Feedback, Guidance and Consultation Hours","The formative assessment for the module will take the form of a short 5 minute presentation on a particular topic, introducing the topic to the rest of the group. To support this a student will produce a short handout of maximum 500 words (and potential many fewer) which accompanies the presentation. This will enable students to begin to research a particular topic, and develop important presentation skills, and verbal reasoning skills.  

The documentary commentary exercise tests knowledge and understanding of the primary sources examined throughout the module. The ability to compare and contrast related primary sources, and explore how they should be interpreted and the relevance to contemporary scholarly debates is an important historical skills. The ability to expound and criticize a textual extract lucidly, succinctly and with relevance in a relatively brief word count tests key historical, analytical and writing skills. In addition, this forms of assessment closely replicates the source commentary questions previously set in examinations for this module in previous academic year, albeit in a different format appropriate for the current situation. 

The final essay for the module tests both students' knowledge and understanding of key historiographical questions in the study of the Soviet camp system, and explores key debates about the origins, evolution, and functions of the Gulag.  There will be an opportunity to think about the different experiences of individuals, and different groups of prisoners (and indeed guards and administrators) with the camps. The final essay will give students an opportunity to explore key themes from lectures and seminars, but also an opportunity for students to develop their own historical arguments supported by the primary evidence that they have been looking at over the course of the module. This form of research-led assessment rewards steady and incremental engagement with the issues explored in the module, and allows students to bring ideas developed from seminars to bear of a major historical question.  

Seminar preparation will help students to develop the skills required to select, prioritise and interpret a wealth of evidence and then use this evidence to support their arguments in their assessed work. All students will deliver a presentation on a prearranged theme, and provide a written handout to accompany and structure that presentation. 

Work submitted during the delivery of the module forms a means of determining student progress.  

Submitted work assesses the intended knowledge and skills outcomes, develops key skills in research, reading and writing, and allows students to demonstrate the historical skills and methodologies they have learnt in this module, and other parts of their degree.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology",Radical Black Archives in the U.S. - Sound and Image,20,Dr Ellie Armon Azoulay,"Students interested in African American history and cultural history will enjoy this module, which explores archival projects consisting of music and sound recordings, photography and paintings from the 20th century until today. Archives and the practice of archiving will be theorized as part of a radical practice of resistance and care enacted by generations of African Americans. It will examine how collecting, sampling, juxtaposing, and archiving methods were used to create visionary archives of Black subjectivity. From songs that documented Black labourers’ working conditions, lapsed love and desire, through paintings that depicted the experiences of the Great Migration, to the first Black-led and run record label in the US, this module will explore how these archival projects became sites for knowledge production and exchange. The module will trace how these archives and their creators sought to document and celebrate Black lives in the face of anti Blackness, racial terror and segregation. Focusing on Black lives and experiences through visual and musical representations, these archival projects and their creators resisted long-lasting racist tropes and stereotypes that originated in slavery and were reborn during the Jim Crow era.



By studying primary and secondary sources, we will question the effect and affect of visual and sonic language and materiality around various issues such as community building, memory, representation, resistance, and storytelling. Students will be encouraged to think through the urgency associated with such a practice. This module is an opportunity to expose the students to various research methodologies and teach them how to approach a range of primary sources from written texts, artworks, recorded music, and archival collections and to examine the potential and limitations of archival projects. The archive is assumed here as a site, a source, the means, and a writing platform capturing and disseminating the Black experience, histories, and voices in the United States and beyond.

The aims of the module are:

1) demonstrate a critical understanding of historical and contemporary archival practices and processes across a range of institutional frameworks and material types;

2) develop proficiency in archival literacy across a range of platforms

3) demonstrate the ability to develop a sustained argument synthesising theoretical concepts and 'archival work' based on a specialised archive/s.

 4) To provide an opportunity to acquire a sound general knowledge of the subject, reading widely and critically in the primary and secondary literature associated with it and develop the capacity for independent study.

5) To provide an opportunity to investigate in some depth selected problems in African American history, including the appraisal of selected source material and the critical examination of current scholarship on African American archives and archival methodologies.",,,,,,"Seminars encourage students to analyse the assigned primary and secondary documents through the sharing of ideas and responses to the readings. Preparation for seminars requires students to do independent reading, requiring good time management and personal responsibility for learning.

The large share of independent study promotes self-directed learning and the effective use of primary and secondary sources. The small group seminars encourage collaborative learning that includes the process of close analysis of primary source material and the development of critical thinking  

Formative assessment, in the form of oral presentations in pairs, will allow students to lead source discussions which will deepen their understanding of the source base as a whole and develop their confidence both in public speaking and in posing questions to other students, skills which are important for the job market as well as for personal development.","Throughout the semester, students will be asked to study and introduce sounds and images relevant to the weekly archives and readings. For mid term assessment, they would write a 2 source commentary of 1000 words. 

For their final projects, students will revise the accumulated material and create in pairs or small groups (max three people) - textual, visual or sonic archives dedicated to a concept, a topic or a question of their choice. 

Using excerpts from different texts, archival documents, sound or/and images, students are invited to conceive their own archive as a collage of existing, missing and transformed voices - fictional, theoretical, or historical. 

The final format of this assessment can be a visual essay, an exhibition, a podcast, or a new musical composition. This creative project should be accompanied by a 2-page statement to explain your project in relation to course key themes and terms and about a few micro-decisions you had to take during the collaborative process.

Formative assessment, in the form of oral presentations in pairs, will allow students to lead source discussions which will deepen their understanding of the source base as a whole and develop their confidence both in public speaking and in posing questions to other students, skills which are important for the job market as well as for personal development.

Essays test students’ abilities to conduct independent research, relate primary source documents to broader problems, the ability to formulate an interpretation of evidence in response to a question, and academic writing skills. The researching and writing of an essay is a tool of learning and understanding rather than merely a means of assessing progress.

The reflective log allows students to develop their understanding of key concepts in the module.

University of Newcastle,NU,"History, Classics and Archaeology","Nineteenth Century Aotearoa New Zealand: Maori, Pakeha & Tauiwi",20,Dr Jen Kain,"This module covers the history of Aotearoa New Zealand between approximately 1800 and 1900. It takes a chronological and thematic approach to the country’s history to account for the settler colonialism which changed the country’s demographics over the nineteenth century based on the appropriation of Maori land. This module considers the relations between Pakeha (white European) and Maori peoples in cultural, political and social terms. It also uses the term Tauiwi (Maori for ‘foreigners') which while is often used interchangeably with Pakeha, offers students the ability to consider who in terms of race, or ‘undesirability’ were excluded from a region idealised as the ‘Britain of the South’. Moving into the latter part of the nineteenth century, the module situates New Zealand in a globalising world, in which its political and social reforms were heralded as state experiments.

The course aims to provide students with an understanding of the following themes:
•       Systematic emigration as de facto colonisation.
•        The role of treaties and land appropriation. 
•        The impact on Te reo Maori (language) and Maoritanga (culture and traditions).
•        The development of political self-governance, suffrage and migration control.
•        The nineteenth century perception of New Zealand as a ‘Better Britain’ and the contradictions therein.

Overall, this module will provide an opportunity for students to acquire a sound general knowledge of Aotearoa New Zealand’s history using a wide range of primary and secondary material. It will challenge them to look more closely at indigenous/coloniser relations, biculturalism and how the region’s history, culture and inhabitants are portrayed today.",,,,,,"The lectures will introduce the students to the key themes and regional considerations (much of which will be new to them). Independent learning and wider reading are at the heart of this module. Students are expected to develop critical reading and note-taking in an independent and effective manner. The extended seminar sessions will allow for a flexible approach towards discussion, interpersonal skill and primary source analysis.","The formative assessment for the module will take the form of a a multiple choice Canvas quiz to test the students' knowledge of te reo Maori. 

The documentary commentary exercise tests knowledge and understanding of the primary sources examined throughout the module. The ability to compare and contrast related primary sources, and explore how they should be interpreted and the relevance to contemporary scholarly debates is an important historical skills. 

The final essay for the module tests both students' knowledge and understanding of the complexity of Maori/Pakeha relations in the nineteenth century.

University of Newcastle,NU,Law,Land Law,20,Dr Bronwen Jones,"This module aims to allow the student to appreciate the purpose and context of land law and to develop a sound knowledge and understanding of the basic principles underlying land law. Land law is a technical subject, which many students find difficult at first. It requires mastery of unfamiliar terms and concepts. Over centuries English courts and Parliaments have built a richly detailed structure of great complexity. The course aims to enable students to understand this structure in its philosophical and historical context.

""Since land provides the physical substratum for all social and economic interaction, the law of land is inevitably an expression of social status and an instrument of social engineering. All of us - even the truly homeless -live somewhere, and each therefore stands in some relation to land as owner- occupier, tenant, licensee or squatter. In this way land law impinges upon a vast area of social orderings and expectations, exerting a fundamental influence on the lifestyles of ordinary people."" Kevin Gray, Elements of Land Law, Butterworths, 1988, p6.

We examine the legal rules and principles underpinning people's rights over land. We look at the changes which have been made to the law in this and the last century and whether further changes might be beneficial to society. The course also directly addresses the following requirements for the SQE: Registered land; Freehold and leasehold estates, and legal and equitable interests in land; and the Landlord and tenant relationship, as well as Co-ownership.

The course will not address unregistered land as it seems unwise (based on past experience to try to teach both registered and unregistered land in such a short time. However, this leaves scope for a further optional module covering other aspects of land law (unregistered land, covenants, and mortgages e.g.)",,,,,,"The use of lecturing as the principal teaching method is justified by the technical nature of the subject and the need to provide initial exposition to assist students in acquiring knowledge and understanding of: the underlying theory and basic principles of Land Law and an understanding of the foundations of Law and Equity, the reforms in Land Law that have led to the development of the two systems of unregistered and registered land, an understanding of estates and interests in land, and an understanding of the importance of adhering to the formalities of creation of estates and interests in land, including registration and the consequences of failing to do so. 

Seminars/workshops focus strongly on the skills outcomes, especially the problem-solving skill, and provide the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge, understanding and application.

'Drop-in/surgery' contact time is provided in this module as part of the Law School assessment and feedback policy such that markers and/or module leaders will offer the opportunity for one-to-one oral feedback on students' written work, in addition to written feedback on coursework front sheets and generic class feedback. The time given above is merely indicative and more time may be scheduled if necessary to meet the demand for individual feedback.",Summative assessment is provided by means of an examination.

The lectures will deliver the substantive content of the module setting out and explaining the essential content, highlighting issues of controversy and where further reading and research is necessary.  The aim of the lectures is to help students achieve the intended knowledge outcomes set out above and providing the foundational basis for the intended skills outcomes set out above. 

Small group teaching: There will be 5 one-hour small group classes. The seminars will provide students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge to problem based and essay based questions and obtain feedback on their approach. The seminars also provide students with the opportunity to learn from each other and to clarify any issues. The seminars help deliver the skills outcomes outlined above and help students prepare for both the coursework and exam components of the module.   

 2 x One hour sessions delivered to whole cohort in person or online as timetabling allows. One in advance of written assessment submission to provide guidance on coursework assessment and essay writing skills and one towards end of module with a focus on answering problem questions. 

Structured Guided Learning: combination of pre-recorded material and text to supplement lectures and MCQs to test knowledge and understanding of substantive content. 

 Independent Study: There are 107 hours allocated to independent guided study and 60 hours to coursework preparation and writing and exam revision and preparation. Students are supported with reading lists and hot topics on the substantive topics studied but also have freedom to pursue their own further reading on specific topics.","The written exercise provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate their written, research and analytical skills and to demonstrate intended learning knowledge and skills outcomes. It provides feedback to students which can help them assess their performance on the module and helps prepare students for the end of year exam.

The teaching activities have the purpose of providing a knowledge base, developing understanding, and refining skills in ways that that will make it possible for students taking the course to deliver richly informed, insightfully researched, and powerfully argued coursework.","Assessed coursework enables students to demonstrate knowledge, understanding, and skills (e.g., research-, interpretation-, and argument-related skills). This medium is particularly suited to developing in students a capacity for analysis and argument on topics that call for critical reflection in the light of research.

The unseen examination enables students to demonstrate knowledge and understanding and to apply a range of skills.  More particularly, it provides a context in which students can demonstrate their ability to identify issues, apply knowledge insightfully to them, and advance arguments that, among other things, bear constructively on areas of controversy in the law.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/nuls/,

3) To understand how the trust operates and how it must operate within these constraints. 

4) To develop critical views on the aims, approaches and doctrine equity takes.",,,,,,"Lecturing will be used to provide an overview of both matters that need to be known in outline (where little further reading is required) and also matters that need to be known in detail, where it must be followed up with self-study from textbook chapters and academic articles. 

Self-study is critical in order for the learner to grasp the detail and to spend time considering the material in depth and working through problems and constructing arguments at a slow enough pace for deep learning. 

Seminars focus on checking the effectiveness of that self-study, where learners can check they have understood the material properly, clear up misunderstandings and explore, in discussion, the further possibilities from where they have got to. 

Learners should close the feedback loop by reconsidering the seminar material they have not fully understood or completed after a seminar in further self-study. 

Drop-in / surgery / office / feedback, guidance and consultation hours are a facility for another way of closing the feedback loop. Here, individual feedback and discussion is provided for matters there was insufficient time to deal with in a seminar, or where the issue was specific to a minority of learners such that the seminar had to more on.","Examination provides an opportunity to demonstrate understanding and skills. In particular, the medium is particularly suitable for problem solving and, further, it allows candidates to demonstrate intended learning outcomes across a broad range of topics within the syllabus.  

The coursework is justified in that it enables candidates to demonstrate in particular the outcome of research, written communication of a sophisticated order and the ability to show depth of understanding together with a range of cognitive skills. 

As noted in the assessment framework, the use of a low-stakes summative assessment can be more beneficial than a formative assessment, hence the arrangement. The students are incentivised to complete it because it carries weight through to the finals, but not so much weight that it can be highly damaging if things go wrong.

(iii) To provide you with an understanding of the interplay between different forces on the legal system, including the influences of comparative legal systems. 

(iii) To develop your skills through different assessment methods, including unorthodox assessment formats such as conference papers and/or written evidence. This will offer a fringe benefit by way of exposure to the nature of an academic career and further study.

(iv) To encourage your ability to undertake student-centred learning through enhancing your critical analysis, research and problem solving skills.",,,,,,"The use of lectures as the dominant form of teaching delivery is justified by the technical nature of the subject and the absence of any overarching textbook to support study. Lectures provide students with an initial exposition to topics in order to assist their knowledge base. Teaching delivery is further facilitated by a series of workshops which use a variety of teaching methods specifically aimed at engaging students’ skills development. This includes presentations, class debates, group work and independent written exercises. Workshops focus on the examination of detailed issues covered in lectures and preparing students for the assessed components of the course.  Workshops take place in a continuous collaborative environment which encourages teamwork and develops independence and leadership. Private study constitutes self-directed learning as well as study on the basis of the previously shared workshop questions and material from designated reading lists.","The emphasis on this module is to develop independent critical thinking, analytic and a combination of written and oral presentation skills. The module is strategically aligned to achieve this with an emphasis on the workshops in order to enhance skills development and prepare students for assessments. The module is assessed through three separate components which centre on a student-led conference. Students are assessed through the submission of a conference abstract research proposal (10%), conference presentation (30%) and coursework submission of the conference paper (60%). The submission of each of these units is consequential in order to assist the students’ continuing skills development. Therefore, the abstract will receive detailed feedback before the student gives their conference presentation, which in turn will receive comments from staff and peers before they submit their written conference paper. 

Each assessment unit receives focused attention during the workshops with the students having multiple opportunities to practice their abstract writing, conference presentation (individually and as a group) and academic writing skills.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/nuls/,

Students will be introduced to the process of mediation, the role of the mediator and learn some key skills required in the resolution of disputes by this method.  

The class shall also examine the interaction between mediation and the law and legal process, in particular looking at such issues as confidentiality, incentives to mediate, adversarialism and civil justice and the role of judges and lawyers within the process. The class considers recent reviews of civil justice for their impact on mediation, the influence that mediation and settlement have held for civil justice as well as critiques of mediation’s ‘institutionalisation’ from the UK and abroad. This module also examines the development of a mediation profession and explores issues such as training, continuous professional development, accreditation and regulation.  Finally the role of the lawyer in mediation from the perspective of dispute forum selector and acting as a party advocate and negotiator in the process is explored.",,,,,,"The principal method of teaching shall be lectures with 18 held over the course of the semester.  Some of the lectures are likely to be more interactive than is standard with student led group work undertaken (where class size and facilities permit).  The purpose of lectures is to provide students with a solid grounding in specific, relevant concepts, rules and ideas. Learning from what worked well in the pandemic the lectures shall be supplemented by non-synchronous online material including short recorded lectures, videos and podcasts and interactive activities.

The purpose of seminars is to allow students to test and deepen their understanding of particular concepts and ideas and develop their analytical and cognitive skills in the context of the close analysis of specific issues and texts. They also offer an opportunity for detailed discussion of issues covered in the lectures, and for developing and practicing essential legal skills of source synthesis and evidence- and research-based argument, as well as for giving feedback on student progress.  In some seminars students will be required to prepare and deliver practical exercises including role plays in the area of mediation and mediation advocacy.

A number of drop in sections shall be made available operating either in person and/or over ZOOM

Put together, the lectures and seminars will encourage an active, integrated approach to study, develop critical thinking and allow for the development of new skills and techniques.

University of Newcastle,NU,Law,Problem Areas in Private Law,20,Dr Christine Beuermann,"In this module, students will explore a small number of problematic areas in private law in some depth.  The areas to be explored will differ from year to year.  The object of the module is not to gain knowledge of specific content (although this will occur), but to consider more broadly why certain areas of private law remain problematic and the different approaches adopted within private law to address such difficulties.  Students will improve their analytical skills in identifying the nature of specific legal problems and their broader understanding of private law by placing those problems in a broader philosophical, historical, comparative and societal context.  The module will particularly enable students to explore tensions and themes within private law, an understanding of which will enable them to better consider how problems that arise in the future may be addressed",,,,,,"This is an advanced module, with students being challenged to develop their own ways of thinking about complex issues.  It is therefore necessary to give students room to develop and refine those ways of thinking.   Online lecture material will be provided at the introduction and conclusion of the module to highlight and bring together various themes that arise within the context of the module.  Each of the four main problem areas will be covered over a period of three weeks.  In the first week, the lecturer will outline the problem area and relevant difficulties.  In the second week, small group teaching will be conducted in which students will be given the opportunity to flesh out and discuss those difficulties in more detail.  These small groups will be teacher led.  In the third week, there will be further small group teaching in which specific readings will be closely examined.  These small groups will be student led with specific students being allocated responsibility to lead the discussion that week.  This method of teaching allows students to fully engage with the problem areas being covered.  Analytical skills will be modelled by staff in the teacher led small groups and students will have opportunity to develop their own skills in the student led small groups. 

Drop-in/Surgery time is provided in this module as part of the Law School assessment and feedback policy such that markers and/or module leaders will offer the opportunity for one-to-one oral feedback on students' work, in addition to written feedback on coursework front sheets and generic class feedback.

University of Newcastle,NU,Law,Private Law Remedies,20,Dr Christine Beuermann,"In this module, students will examine the range of remedies that might be available in a private law claim.  The module will be useful for students looking to progress to practice as a solicitor or a barrister as remedies are an important component of bringing any legal claim, and are specifically examined as part of the new Solicitors Regulation Authority exams.  This is an advanced module and students will need a thorough understanding of the range of private law claims that might be brought in any given situation.  The remedies will be studied in a practical context with students introduced to a range of legal skills that might be utilised in practice, including client interviewing, preparing a letter of advice, negotiation and/or mooting.",,,,,,"Students will be encouraged in this module to think about private law beyond the boundaries of the modules which they have previously studied (eg contract, tort and equity).  They will do this by comparing the various remedies that are available for private law claims.  By focussing on the interests of prospective clients, students will develop the necessary skills to identify and select appropriate private law remedies.  The lectures in this module will be used to examine the various remedies that are available for private law claims.  In the workshops, students will be taught practical skills that they will utilise in legal practice and use those skills to advocate appropriate remedial responses for hypothetical clients.","The assessment in this module is practically oriented, to enable students to see the significance of private law remedies to legal practice.

In a workshop at the beginning of this module, students will undertake a client interview to assess what information might be relevant to obtain from a client to be able to properly advise that client on an appropriate remedial response to their claim.  This is formative only to allow students to ‘learn by doing’.  It will enable students to make necessary connections between legal claims and facts and to think more broadly about the private law they have already studied in their degree.

After receiving appropriate skills development training, students will then put the knowledge of remedial law they have developed in this module into practice by completing two professional skills development assessments.  The first is a letter of advice to a client in which the student will be required to explain the remedial options available to the client in the circumstances and which option is to be preferred and why.  In the second, students will take steps to secure that remedy for the client through either a negotiation or moot (at the election of the student).

2) To foster awareness of how popular nationalism is channelled by the state as a means to promote national unification, and of how popular nationalism may also undermine the state;

3) To develop an appreciation of the relative construction of the Han majority identity vis-a-vis the minority nationality identities;

4) To build knowledge of the historical and contemporary origins of Uyghur and Tibetan ethno-nationalisms, and to explore ways in which minority nationalities construct and express alternative identities to those imposed by the state / the Han majority.

- Prepare students for the future study of the language (written communicative and oral / aural skills);
- Facilitate students' ability to establish and maintain effective social and working relations with speakers of the foreign language in written and spoken output.
- Develop independent language learning strategies.

This module is intended for students wishing to study French at beginner level, both true beginners and students with a limited prior knowledge of French.

- Linguistic knowledge and the ability to use language effectively (i.e. linguistic skills) are intrinsically linked.
- Teaching and learning these outcomes (knowledge and skills) effectively implies presenting, practising and consolidating them via language classes and private study as indicated above.

Relationship of Teaching and Learning Methods to Learning Outcomes:
- The integration of linguistic knowledge i.e. vocabulary, grammar, functions, notions and knowledge of the cultures in French-speaking countries and the key skills of reading, writing, speaking and listening is appropriately served by the language classes through suitable presentations and plenty of practice through  individual, pair and group work. 
- In common with other foreign languages, French requires substantial ’structured guided learning’ and ‘guided independent study’.  Through this study:
 (1) the knowledge introduced and practised in the classes is previewed, revised, consolidated and expanded. 
 (2) students are also given opportunities to practise further reading, writing and listening skills. 
 (3) students learn to evaluate their own performance and develop a range of strategies for language learning.
-To ensure the learning of the above outcomes is effective, formative feedback is given in two ways:
 (1) indirectly through self-assessment e.g. through internet and commercially available answer keys and
 (2) directly by the teacher e.g. in the writing skills exercises which students carry out on a regular basis.

The module is divided into 3 blocks. Each block comprises 2 key films. Screening notes will be provided for each film and students will be expected to discuss these in groups prior to the seminars. In addition, each week will have one or two essential preparatory readings, and these, along with pre-recorded lectures, will provide context and frame the key debates that will inform seminar discussions.

Activities will be set as part of the guided study to allow students to familiarize themselves with film language and analysis, and group analysis activities carried out in class will reinforce this.

Scheduled learning and teaching activities: Note-taking, teamwork, arguing opinions, evaluating sources, analysing sequences, oral communication and presentation skills, problem-solving.

Structured Guided Learning: Note-taking, teamwork (including initiative, adaptability and interpersonal communication), arguing opinions, analysing sequences, oral and written communication, independent research.

Seminars might consist of small group breakouts where students can road test ideas before sharing them.","Digital Gallery (60%)
For this class, we will be building our own museum about French imperialism. This assignment is broken into two parts: collecting items and designing an exhibit. This project has three goals: First, to do the work that historians do of finding, describing, and analysing historical items. Second, to create a collaborative educational resource from your research. And third, for us to reflect on the close history between imperialism and museum collecting. We will work with Omeka - it’s amazingly easy to use, so no digital humanities/CS experience is required. For most of our course weeks, we will be working on collecting items for the gallery. Students will find objects they think might be interesting to the history of French imperialism. These objects might be texts, posters, artworks, sculptures, films, advertisements, material culture. Since this is for a gallery space, students will add short, powerful descriptions and basic information about the object’s creation (1-2 paragraphs in French). During the semester, I will prompt students to think about shaping these items into specific exhibitions within the museum via a topic, theme, or type of source that seems interesting and historically important. What do we learn by grouping these items together? What perspective do they give us on the history of French imperialism? What aspects of history do these items leave out or whose voices do they suppress? Students will write a 700-1000 word description that will act as the written text, introducing the exhibition, which will address the idea behind the exhibit. This assessment will be given a group mark for the overall work, and an individual mark for the sections written and conceived alone. 

Source Analysis (40%)
In addition, there will be an assessment which entails annotations of one of the weekly sources using online platform hypothesis. Students will be expected to write a source analysis (1000 words) of one the sources covered in class but, ideally, a source chosen with my guidance. The weekly writing will have prepared students for this work. This exercise is to develop students’ research skills, and a close reading of one source in the context of the secondary material read in this course. The idea is to encourage focused engagement and critical reading and argument skills. 

Weekly Reflection Questions/Hypothesis/Annotations 
Formative assessment will take the form of the submission of weekly 150-200 word responses.
Sometimes this writing is a matter of routine—a time to settle the mind, a much-needed moment of individual focus in students’ socially and intellectually saturated lives, a time to develop a close relationship with a detail in the text. Often it goes further: students are taken aback not only by how much they have to say about a few lines, but also by how much their thinking changes as they write, beginning with impressionistic evaluation and ending with an excursus on a single word. In addition to habituating writing as a mode of thinking—something I ask classes of all sizes to do when a tricky question or passage comes up—this practice also challenges each person to find meaning in the text on the basis of its language in odd or oblique ways, rather than trying to speak collectively toward consensus or a “main idea.” Weekly writing frequently can demystify the process of writing and it can also create an enormously inspiring archive of nuanced paper topics.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/mls/,

Rationale of Teaching Methods

Lectures will provide the essential context and will introduce students to theoretical notions around contemporary ideas of the self, autobiographical writing, and marginality, while underlining the specificities of the current social and political landscape of the French and Francophone world. Furthermore, lecture materials will highlight how theoretical notions are reflected in and through the texts and films. The lecture will also provide a first look into the text or visual material by looking at its main themes as well as its structure.  Students will be expected to watch pre-recorded lectures in advance with lecture notes to be published on Canvas afterwards. Furthermore, students will be expected to work through accompanying directed reading and viewing as well as supplementary materials which will be clearly signposted on Canvas.
The module is designed following a blended learning mode of teaching  as it has showed to be very effective as it allowed students to reflect in their own time.

The seminar is based on the systematic study of primary sources (texts, photographs, films, etc) together with relevant secondary sources (selected critical works, such as journal articles or chapters, alongside videos, podcasts, reviews, or author/director interviews). In seminars, students will analyse the materials in detail, working through the issues raised by the lectures with support and added clarifications or examples where needed. This will include detailed analysis of selected sections of a text or film as well as larger group discussions steered by questions prepared in advance by the seminar leader (in the form of a worksheet or a PowerPoint presentation). Seminars will include small group breakouts where students will be invited to answer different questions the seminar leader has prepared in advance that they can then share with the larger seminar group. Some weeks, students will deliver presentations on a pre-approved topic.

Students will be expected to deliver a brief presentation (10 min max if working alone, 20 min max if they work as a pair) on a pre-approved topic/question on one of the set texts or visual materials. The exercise will test the students’ ability to develop a coherent argument and to present it in a convincing, professional manner in oral form. It will assess the students’ capacity to engage with autobiographical texts and visual material and to situate them in a contemporary context while reflecting on their enmeshment with external forces, be they social, political, religious, or ideological among others. The students will be required to engage their peers by formulating a question which furthers the scope of their presentation following its conclusion. The students will receive written feedback from their module leader.

The students will be required to engage their peers by formulating a question which furthers the scope of their podcast topic which will be discussed in class. The podcast will be pre-circulated for all students to be able to engage with the material. The students will receive written feedback from their module leader. Relevant podcasts will be circulated as examples/templates. This assessment provides a built-in alternative for students who may be unable to deliver an in-person presentation while still honing their oral argumentative skills.

Essay (in English, 2500 words) (70%)
The students will choose from a set of essay questions that have been designed to test their ability to engage with the representation of the self in contemporary French and Francophone culture and to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of the social, political and formal context. The students will be expected to demonstrate an ability to perform independent research, thus testing their ability to search for, identify, and select relevant sources. They will be tested on their capacity to build a coherent argument drawing from these sources while honing their own critical skills.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/mls/,

-        introduce students to specialised business French language,
-        provide students with an ability to develop a level of spoken and written proficiency in professional 
        and academic environments,
-        introduce students to basic key concepts in business and to the francophone business environment.",,,,,,"The lectures will be given in the target language and will provide students with the key knowledge on the francophone business environment and basic key concepts in business.
The workshops will provide students with the opportunity to discuss the knowledge presented in the lectures. They will introduce, model and offer guidance on the skills that students are required to practice during the course (commentary writing of business materials, preparation of poster presentation…)
Group work will offer students an opportunity to work in small groups (in the target language) under close supervision of the lecturer and will focus on the skills listed in the outline syllabus.

Teaching will be mostly in the target language.

Work requirements:
-        researching materials for the poster presentation and discussion
-        writing critical analysis of business materials in the target language","The students abilities are assessed by means of a written examination in order to ensure that the students’ output is produced in identical conditions and is their own work.

- To provide students with a solid knowledge of how, and according to which social and regional factors, language use varies in France and the rest of the Francophone world.
- To provide students with a solid knowledge of aspects of general sociolinguistic theory possibly relevant to language use in France in particular.
- To provide preparation for the Year Abroad.
- To provide students with the knowledge necessary to carry out detailed studies of language variation in France, either during their Year Abroad, or during Stage 4.
- Through the assessed presentation requirement, to provide students with practice in presenting information to an audience.
- To provide students with the opportunity to carry out genuine research, even at undergraduate level. This could arise either through the essay or through the students applying the knowledge gained in this module, when they are in French-speaking countries in the following year: for example, they could take voice-recorders abroad, carry out interviews, and analyse those interviews for a Dissertation in Stage 4. All the students will be offered this opportunity, but whether or not to take it would be entirely up to individuals.",,,,,,"The lectures will convey key content issues. In the seminars, students will:
- either present and discuss some of these issues, applying them to real-world data;
- or carry out practical activities (such as textual analysis) to apply the knowledge gained in lectures.

These discussions and activities will provide knowledge and practice which will be of practical use during students’ Year Abroad in Francophone countries, as well as a solid intellectual foundation for relevant Stage 4 and postgraduate study. The assessed presentation will provide students with practice in a skill which is increasingly important for employment. The mark for participation will encourage class discussion, which is essential, as sociolinguistics is based on observation of language.

Students are expected to read preparatory material as well as attending lectures and seminars.","The essay is heavily weighted so as to give the highest proportion of marks to a component that students can spend time researching, and where they do not have to feel under pressure to perform in a given short time.

The presentation is assessed so as to give students an incentive to produce a good presentation, which will be able to provoke discussion in the class, and could be useful for their future research (e.g. for the essay). To reflect the fact that 20% of the marks for the module will be gained in a single period of about 20 minutes, the lecturer will be prepared to discuss presentations with students (and indeed will require them to consult him before choosing a topic to present on). Presenters in a given week will be required to present on a topic related to that week’s lectures, or in a previous week’s lectures (but not in a future week’s lectures) (topics to be identified by the presenters).

Fiction and documentary films, drawn from both popular and auteurist cinema will be used to explore important concepts in film studies such as: realism, the relationship between film and the real, and between film and contemporary reality; stardom; genre; cultural identities and representation. In addition, we will explore the context - both industrial and socio-political – in which the films are made, focusing in particular on ideas of the national and how they link to republican values, Europe and the legacies of colonialism.

Films to be studied may include: Intouchables (Nakache and Toledano, 2012), Bande de filles (Sciamma, 2014), Potiche (Ozon, 2010), Nous (Diop, 2020), Orlando Ferito (Dieutre, 2013), L’Image manquante (Panh, 2013).

The module will be taught in two blocks; the first focusing on fiction films will be taught in French and the second, on documentary, in English. In each week, students will have a recorded lecture and a two-hour seminar. It has been decided to retain lectures as recordings for three reasons: 
·         Evaluation from last year showed that a majority of students appreciated the online elements as part of the module contact hours.
·         The blended learning mode of teaching showed to be very effective as it allowed students to reflect in their own time.
·         The external examiner comments suggested this worked well. 

Each block will focus on three main films which will be used for assessment, plus additional contextual viewing. Screening notes will be provided for each of the main films and students will be expected to discuss these in groups prior to the seminars. In addition, each week will have essential and recommended preparatory readings, and these (along with the pre-recorded lectures), will provide context and frame the key debates that will inform discussion in the present-in-person seminars.
Class discussion will support comprehension, encourage students to relate the films they are studying to their wider knowledge and to engage with different types of primary and secondary sources. Seminars will allow students to test their knowledge and develop skills of critical engagement with these sources, including close textual analysis, discourse analysis and evaluating sources. If in-person teaching is not possible, the seminars can be run as online Zoom classes.

Preparatory work for the lectures and seminars: bibliographical work, planning and organizing, independent and group study.
Lectures: Note-taking; time management.
Seminars: Note-taking, teamwork (including initiative, adaptability and interpersonal communication), developing an argument, evaluating sources, analysing sequences, oral communication and presentation skills, problem solving.

2.        Essay of 3000 words (70%), in English, in which students will be expected to demonstrate an understanding of context and film style as well as to engage critically with appropriate academic sources. Questions will be designed to test the students' ability to draw on specific textual analysis of the films, as well as demonstrating links between formal aspects of the films and the broader concepts discussed in lectures, in order to show their overall understanding of the period and its key films. Students will be expected to have acquired a good knowledge of relevant scholarly writing as well as the films themselves.

Questions will be designed to test the students' ability to draw on their awareness of key issues in Algerian culture and society, and to demonstrate how these issues are expressed in film. They are expected to demonstrate links between their own analysis of the film/s and the broader socio-cultural concepts discussed in lectures, in order to show their overall understanding of Algerian culture. Students will be expected to have acquired a good knowledge of relevant scholarly writing as well as of the set films themselves. This component of the assessment will also be in French and will allow students to demonstrate the ability to communicate ideas and arguments fluently and succinctly in French, and to develop the following skills: independent research, bibliographical work, planning and organizing, word-processing, footnoting and referencing.
In addition, there will be a formative assessment. This will be set in the first half of the semester and will take the form of an extended essay introduction. Students will have to reflect on the purpose of the introduction in setting out the hypothesis, key debates and in outlining the plan of the essay, and provide feedback on a colleague’s work. This exercise will help develop the following skills: critical review, developing and communicating an argument, planning and organising.

•        To introduce students to selected frameworks theorizing change in French, and to attendant methodological tools
•        To enable students to pursue further diachronic questions themselves",,,,,,"A mix of lectures, small-group teaching (seminars), and independent study is best suited to the module’s intended learning outcomes.

Lectures are shared with SML8105.","The essay is heavily weighted so as to give the highest proportion of marks to a component that students can spend time researching, and where they do not have to feel under pressure to perform in a given short time.

The presentation is assessed so as to give students an incentive to produce a good presentation, which will be able to provoke discussion in the class, and could be useful for their future research (e.g. for the essay). To reflect the fact that 30% of the marks for the module will be gained in a single period of about 20 minutes, the lecturer will be prepared to discuss presentations with students (and indeed will require them to consult him before choosing a topic to present on). Presenters in a given week will be required to present on a topic related to that week’s lectures, or to a previous week’s lectures (but not principally to a future week’s lectures, though forward links can be indicated).

University of Newcastle,NU,Modern Languages,From Experimental to Explicit: Translating Women's Writing in French (Inactive),20,Dr Pauline Henry-Tierney,"In consonance with the overall aims of the degrees offered in the SML, the aims of this module are:

- to introduce students to different trends in (and examples of) contemporary French and Francophone women’s writing;
- to encourage critical thinking on the relationships between translation and contemporary women’s writing in French, particularly in relation to the dynamics between translation and gender; translation and sexuality; and translation and corporeality;
- to introduce the core theoretical concepts of gender-conscious approaches to translation such as feminist translation theory;
- to improve students’ skills in translating literary texts from French into English 
- to develop an ability to analyse and evaluate specific translation strategies in their own and other translators’ work.",,,,,,"Lectures will allow for the introduction of the key trends in contemporary women’s writing in French and the main theoretical concepts related to gender conscious approaches to its translation. Students will make use of the notes they take in lectures, as well as lecture PowerPoints and handouts in order to hone their knowledge base of the aforementioned fields of study. In seminars, students will develop their ability to read and translate excerpts from literary texts. By comparing source texts and published translated texts, as well as their own prepared translation of a given textual excerpt, students will develop the capacity to argue intelligibly for and against specific translation decisions. Through in-class group discussion and translation slams, students will develop the ability to evaluate their own and others’ translations. The language of delivery for this module will be English but will enhance students’ linguistic capacity in French too since it will involve reading and translating French source texts. Private study time will be devoted to an initial reading of the relevant textual extracts and to a more detailed analysis of relevant published translations, as well as reading and note-taking from secondary critical sources and additional teaching material. This will be available primarily through Canvas or through the Robinson library, and students will develop their independent learning skills and research techniques.","The extended translation and reflective commentary allow students to demonstrate their ability to read and translate women’s writing in French applying gender-conscious translation strategies. The reflective commentary component will allow students to evaluate their own translation critically and argue convincingly for or against specific translation strategies. The formative assessment helps prepare them for this challenge. The translation and commentary assignment will in turn inform students’ critical and reflective approach to the essay. The essay requires students to engage with the theoretical knowledge gained during the module and encourages students to study in depth a particular aspect of the issues addressed in the module related to the translation of women’s writing in French. The essay assessment also develops students’ skills in bibliographical work, footnoting and referencing.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/humanities/mls/,
University of Newcastle,NU,Modern Languages,From Surrealism to Street Art: Theories and Practices of the City,20,Dr Gillian Jein,"In keeping with the overall aims of the degrees offered in the SML, this module aims to build on skills gained at Stages 1 and 2, and to provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the role played by cultural production in the construction and experience of cities in the modern and contemporary French context. Through engagement with key theories and material practices, the module will provide students with an understanding of social, cultural and political debates on, and interventions in, cities from the early twentieth century to today. The module encourages students to reflect on the agency of various actors —architects, planners, artists and residents — in processes of urban construction, deconstruction and regeneration. It  invites students to question the role of textual and visual practices in constructing and deconstructing the social, cultural and spatial landscape,how such practices invest the cityscape with cultural meaning, as well as potentially challenge economic and political models for its understanding.

The module aims therefore: 
1 To provide an understanding of contemporary debates around the city and their historical context; 
2 To encourage students to examine the constructed nature of urban environments, and to engage critically with the commonsense notion of ‘place’.
3 To enhance students’ theoretical knowledge of important theoretical debates in French urban thought, through, through examination of discourses and counter-discourses produced by urbanists, artists, architects and inhabitants.
4 To prepare students for postgraduate study by developing cross-disciplinary knowledge through the use of core themes that permit engagement with anthropological, ecological, historical, geo-political as well as cultural approaches to urban place. 
5. To develop students disciplinary and linguistic expertise in French by engaging with a range of cultural media – from travel writing, fiction, visual culture and situational art forms — that promote linguistic knowledge in the areas of urbanism and regeneration, geopolitics, ethnography, visual cultural studies and environmentalism.",,,,,,"Module to provide students with in-depth knowledge of French urban cultures, applying interdisciplinary
methodologies. Module’s primary corpus is to meet Learning Outcomes (LO1–4) by enabling students to engage with
texts from fields including urban anthropology, architecture, planning & resistive manifestos, and to apply theories from here to urban cultural production such as buildings, urban literature, photography, posters, graffiti and street art.

Structured Guided Learning:
1)Lecture Materials:2 30-min ‘snap lectures’ per week to intro topic, provide key info and deliver 3 critical questions per video. Videos will provide students with intros to debates on urbanism in historical context. (LO 1&2;Skills Outcomes 5,7&8)
 Student feedback proved that these online mini-lectures provided convenient and constructive learning tools for students.

2)Structured Research & Reading Activities;

Reading: Students read 1-2 article-length primary materials weekly. Accompanied by 5-8 guided questions to facilitate student engagement and encourage close reading (IKO 2;ISO 5,8&9)

Writing: To ensure reading is engaged, students write 200-word response to set material. Either to answer guiding questions or link text from one week to a text from another. Students write 6 responses to be submitted online via CANVAS to module leader in advance of scheduled small group session.ML provides individual feedback and draws on responses to develop student discussion in small group scheduled sessions. Written responses to be formative assignment for module (IKO 3&4;ISO 6–10)

3) Structured non-synchronous discussion: Students engage in 2 targeted non-synchronous online discussions (TW1 & TW12)

Students invited to ask questions and queries re Module Intro talk (40-min video) and share concerns re moving online etc. Discussion moderated by ML at scheduled time. B is in TW8;provides students with chance to raise queries about summative essay. Through set questions, students reflect on what makes good essay and how they can use what they have learnt from formative short weekly responses (IKO 2;ISO 6,10&11)

Small Group Teaching: Small group seminars delivered in 2-hr sessions to allow sustained discussion on topic for the week (IKO 1–4).First half-hr ensures critical engagement with filmed lecture and reading materials. Rest of time is discussion of students’ formative response to reading. Seminars allow space for students to share and develop ideas through peer-to-peer feedback.ML draws on critical insights raised by students to structure discussion. Seminars are student-led to facilitate active participation to:

-Develop critical and analytical skills, learn to construct coherent arguments and to use textual and visual evidence to support them, and testing these in supportive space of the small learning environment (ISO 6)
-Develop bibliographical and reflective, critical writing skills, and develop review skills to enable synthetic reflection on materials from which to construct coherent arguments (ISO 7,8&9)
-Teaching of theory alongside practices in urban culture develops students’ facility for cross-reference across
disciplines and open out the range of perspectives to be considered when studying cultural production (IKO 1–4)
Seminars require guided preparation and close reading of set texts/images. Formative weekly assignment is designed so students feel implicated in the discussion even if not present in person. Sessions enrich students’ critical and analytical skills through focused, individualized feedback, sharing of responses to texts, and testing rigour of arguments in supportive learning environment.

Guided Independent Study: Each week students engage in independent activities to support and enhance learning
experience. Assessment preparation is a significant portion of this study time. Discussion
board will be available to students on CANVAS to support learning.","Summative Assessment:

Essay in English of 2500 words (80%), in which students will be expected to apply theoretical models studied throughout the module to the study of cultural objects, and in doing so to demonstrate understanding of the socio-historical context of the object’s production, theorize its response to course themes as appropriate, and engage critically with relevant academic sources. 

The students will choose from a set of essay questions that have been designed to test their ability to respond to key issues in French urban thought on the city (such as rationalism; everyday life; regeneration; memory; non-place; and marginalization), and to demonstrate how these issues are expressed in cultural practices. They are expected to demonstrate links between their own analysis of these cultural objects and the broader concepts discussed in lectures and fleshed out in small group sessions. Students will be expected to have acquired a good knowledge of relevant scholarly writing as well as of the cultural objects themselves. 

This component of the assessment will be in English so as to allow students to leave aside any linguistic anxieties they might have around their level of French and to demonstrate their ability to communicate ideas and arguments fluently, and to develop the following skills: independent research, bibliographical work, planning and organizing, word-processing, footnoting and referencing.

Oral presentation (in French with visual aids (e.g. powerpoint and/or visual materials) (20%). Students must deliver a brief presentation (15 mins max) on a set piece of cultural production e.g. photograph, painting, street art, map, textual extract or building. The exercise is designed to test students’ oral presentation skills as well as their capacity to situate a cultural object in socio-historical context, to handle a variety of aesthetic and formal approaches to urban life through a detailed exploration of how the object responds to one or more of the themes covered in the course.  They will be required to give feedback on each other’s’ presentations, and will also receive feedback from the module leader.

Formative Assessment:

In addition, there will be a formative assessment which entails the submission of a short, 200-word critical responses to set reading over the course of 6 weeks (TW2, TW3, TW4, TW5, TW6, TW7). Students will have to reflect on the purpose of the set reading, identify and review the core ideas of the text, highlight any notable features, and as weeks progress, link ideas across the set texts. The idea here is to encourage precise, focused engagement that will enhance student engagement with the materials as well encourage development of their critical reading and writing skills over the entire module. Students will be given weekly feedback and their writings used as a basis for small group discussion sessions, as well as to encourage comparative peer-to-peer feedback and discussion. This exercise will help develop the following skills: critical review, developing and communicating an argument, planning and organizing, meeting deadlines, developing independent thought in a guided way, teamwork, interpersonal communication, and problem solving.

> To invite students to reflect on the concept of self in the contemporary moment and the ways in which it is creatively represented.

> To familiarize students with key critical concepts drawing from a variety of fields including queer studies, sociology, psychoanalysis, postcolonial theory, literary theory, and film studies. 

> To expose students to current debates in contemporary French and Francophone society and culture around questions of class, race, religion, gender, human and legal rights.",,,,,,"This module will run over 11 weeks, and will consist of a weekly 2h seminar and of a mixture of 1 hour or 30 minute lectures. 


Rationale of Teaching Methods

Lectures will provide the essential context and will introduce students to theoretical notions around contemporary ideas of the self, autobiographical writing, and marginality, while underlining the specificities of the current social and political landscape of the French and Francophone world. Furthermore, lecture materials will highlight how theoretical notions are reflected in and through the texts and films. The lecture will also provide a first look into the text or visual material by looking at its main themes as well as its structure.  Students will be expected to watch pre-recorded lectures in advance with lecture notes to be published on Canvas afterwards. Furthermore, students will be expected to work through accompanying directed reading and viewing as well as supplementary materials which will be clearly signposted on Canvas.
The module is designed following a blended learning mode of teaching  as it has showed to be very effective as it allowed students to reflect in their own time.

The seminar is based on the systematic study of primary sources (texts, photographs, films, etc) together with relevant secondary sources (selected critical works, such as journal articles or chapters, alongside videos, podcasts, reviews, or author/director interviews). In seminars, students will analyse the materials in detail, working through the issues raised by the lectures with support and added clarifications or examples where needed. This will include detailed analysis of selected sections of a text or film as well as larger group discussions steered by questions prepared in advance by the seminar leader (in the form of a worksheet or a PowerPoint presentation). Seminars will include small group breakouts where students will be invited to answer different questions the seminar leader has prepared in advance that they can then share with the larger seminar group. Some weeks, students will deliver presentations on a pre-approved topic.

Students will be expected to deliver a brief presentation (15 min max if working alone, 30 min max if they work as a pair) on a topic/question  designed by the students (and approved by the seminar leader/module convenor) on one of the set texts or visual materials. The exercise will test the students’ ability to develop a coherent argument and to present it in a convincing, professional manner in oral form. It will assess the students’ capacity to engage with autobiographical texts and visual material and to situate them in a contemporary context while reflecting on their enmeshment with external forces, be they social, political, religious, or ideological among others. The students will be required to engage their peers by formulating a question which furthers the scope of their presentation following its conclusion. The students will receive written feedback from their module leader.

Podcast (in English or French, pre-recording) (30%)

Students will be expected to record a podcast (15 min max if working alone, 30 min max if they work as a pair) on a topic/question  designed by the students (and approved by the seminar leader/module convenor). The podcast may either be an argumentative one-person piece or can take the form of an argumentative dialogue if produced as a pair. In the same way as the oral presentations, the exercise will test the students’ ability to develop a coherent argument and to present it in a convincing, professional manner in oral form. It will assess the students’ capacity to engage with autobiographical texts and visual material and to situate it in a contemporary context while reflecting on its enmeshment with external forces, be they social, political, religious, or ideological among others. The students will be required to engage their peers by formulating a question which furthers the scope of their podcast topic which will be discussed in class. The podcast will be pre-circulated for all students to be able to engage with the material. The students will receive written feedback from their module leader. Relevant podcasts will be circulated as examples/templates. This assessment provides a built-in alternative for students who may be unable to deliver an in-person presentation while still honing their oral argumentative skills.

Essay (in English, 3000 words) (70%)

The students will design their own essay question which will be approved by the module convenor/seminar leader.  The question will need to test their ability to engage with the representation of the self in contemporary French and Francophone culture and to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of the social, political and formal context. The students will be expected to demonstrate an ability to perform independent research, thus testing their ability to search for, identify, and select relevant sources.

This module explores the ways in which murder has been represented in modern German literature and film, focusing on representations of murder created or set round about the first half of the 20th century. Murder, as the ultimate transgressive act, is shown to be a testing ground for questions about the legal framework of a given society, the integrative and normative force of such a framework, and the power relations played out in transgressions and restitutions of the law. Examples from both film and literature cover a range of differently motivated murders, ranging from social causes or economic pressures to killings born of ideological reasons, as well as to murders brought about by mental illness or psychological factors. By analysing these killings in their social and political contexts, the changing approaches to dealing with crime in modern German societies will emerge, which will allow for both a typology and a cultural & political historiography of extreme transgression.

The module will be partly taught in German, partly in English. The exam will be in German. The essay will be in English.",,,,,,"The scheduled teaching and learning activities will introduce students to legal and philosophical concepts to do with crime, law, and justice, as well as to the background of individual texts and films on the syllabus.

The mixture of lectures and seminars will provide the opportunity for students to (1) acquire research-led in-depth knowledge of this field of study and its wider significance, and (2) to use the acquired knowledge as a basis for classroom discussions of the key sources and the issues raised in the scholarship. The course is designed to encourage students to apply the critical abilities and contextual knowledge they acquired to the specific case studies. Lectures will provide students with an introduction to the main issues covered by the module.

This module explores the ways in which murder has been represented in modern German literature and film, focusing on representations of murder created or set round about the first half of the 20th century. Murder, as the ultimate transgressive act, is shown to be a testing ground for questions about the legal framework of a given society, the integrative and normative force of such a framework, and the power relations played out in transgressions and restitutions of the law. Examples from both film and literature cover a range of differently motivated murders, ranging from social causes or economic pressures to killings born of ideological reasons, as well as to murders brought about by mental illness or psychological factors. By analysing these killings in their social and political contexts, the changing approaches to dealing with crime in modern German societies will emerge, which will allow for both a typology and a cultural & political historiography of extreme transgression.

The online forum is beneficial as this is in line with the new work environment that has been adapted worldwide during the pandemic. This is unlikely to change even as the pandemic gets under control -- companies and international organisations can see a huge financial benefit to maintaining certain interactions online. By having some online live seminars, the module prepares students for this new working environment, which is especially common in Euro-Asian relations. 

In drop-in surgeries, the students can seek advice from the lecturers on the coursework and their personal essays.

Throughout the module, audio visual materials including films and documentary will also be used to support learning. Time will also be dedicated to sessions on how to do a presentation and write an essay.

To gain fully from the module, students are expected to engage actively and express their opinion and thoughts in seminars and in writing on Canvas.","The essay will allow students to demonstrate a solid knowledge of contemporary Japanese culture and society, developed via critical analysis of popular cultural texts. Goal setting & action planning, independence and active learning will be tested together with written skills, critical thinking, innovation and creativity and self-awareness and reflection.

University of Newcastle,NU,Modern Languages,Comparative History of Hispano-America and Brazil: from Independence to the Mexican Revolution (1789/1810-1917),20,Professor Jens R Hentschke,"In consonance with the degrees offered in the SML, this module aims:
•        to build on skills and knowledge gained at Stage 1.
•        to provide students with an in-depth knowledge of Latin American history in the ‘long 19th century’ with its lasting legacies. 
•        to prepare students for more specialist study at Stage 4. 
•        to make aspects of the above available to students from outside the degree.

The main purpose of this course is to give students an idea of the similarities and divergences in the historical development of Latin American countries during the key period from Independence to the Mexican Revolution. In contrast to Western Europe and North America, in Latin America ‘Independencia’ state-building preceded nation-building. Iberian mercantilism gave way to an economic re-colonisation by Great Britain, while France remained the major cultural reference point during the ‘long 19th century’. Yet, 'Amérique Latine' was an artificial construct, suggesting that the more than two dozen Latin American countries formed a kind of homogenous bloc. 

The course will make you aware that, from their Conquest, Spanish and Portuguese America, let alone French Saint-Domingue (an important excursus), had been separated by more than language and natural barriers, and you will understand why Liberator Simón Bolivar failed in maintaining at least the territorial integrity of the four Spanish viceroyalties. We will look at the 'caudillo' dictatorships which followed political emancipation and contrast them to Brazil's ambivalent attempts to forge a nation post facto; analyse the liberal reforms of the mid-19th century in Colombia, Mexico and Argentina; compare Cuba's anti-slavery and belated pro-Independence movements with Brazil's abolitionists and republicans; and learn about Uruguay’s transformation into Latin America’s first welfare state democracy and Mexico’s paradigmatic 1910-17 revolution.",,,,,,"In the planning session, students will be introduced to the intellectual and organisational design of the course, learn about the applied teaching methods and how to analyse primary sources, and hear about the formative and summative assessments. This will be followed by material that embeds this course on the ‘long nineteenth century’ into a broader disciplinary, temporal, and global context. Students will be able to establish links between the different Area Studies, Area Studies and systematic disciplines, and literary and other texts, and they will be pointed to the significance of the studied period for explaining Latin America’s current travails. The core of the module follows a strictly comparative design: it focuses on major periods of transformation in Latin America and uses exemplary and deviant cases. Online lecture materials will allow for definition of the scope of the syllabus, an introduction to a body of knowledge, and modelling of the analysis required (note-taking). These materials, which deal with a complex matter, will remain part of the 33 contact hours. Students have expressed very high regard for these high-quality recordings because they can work through them in their own time and well in advance of the workshops and seminars, and this has also proven to be very beneficial for those with SSPs. Workshops, which are linked to the lecture blocks, will consolidate students’ knowledge and train their hermeneutic skills in analysing documentaries and key primary sources. Seminars will give them the possibility to consolidate their knowledge in individual and group presentations and apply a comparative analysis. The workshop on exam preparation is to provide students with advice about how to read exam questions and give a concise and well-argued answer. 

In case PIP teaching were not possible in general or for this module leader, workshops and seminars could take place in synchronous remote form.","Summative assessments: In the in-class test, students should demonstrate both core knowledge of Latin American History, acquired in lectures, and the ability to historically place and briefly criticise a textual extract, trained in the workshops. The formal written exam will allow them to convey good understanding of at least one broader period of Latin American history previously studied in a whole teaching block. They will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge to specific cases and to highlight their similarities and divergences. This form of assessment provides an occasion to practice written communication as well as analytical and problem-solving skills. 

Formative assessment: Presentations on the ‘real’ exam/essay questions of the previous year have become a longstanding and well-received practice. They act as a mock, and students then know exactly what type of questions they can expect in the summative assessment and that they should focus on an overarching thesis and operationalise it. 

Alternative assessments: The class-test could become a 24 taking-home exam but would then have to exclude the factual questions; students would just analyse the extract from the primary source in 500 words.

In addition, this module aims to make aspects of the above available to non-language students from other Schools.",,,,,,"**The blended learning mode of teaching showed to be very effective as it allowed students to reflect in their own time.**

Lecture materials, in the form of non-synchronous recordings and activities made available on the VLE, allow definition of the scope of the syllabus, an introduction to a body of knowledge, and modelling of the analysis required. They will provide contextual information relevant to the films, and introduce students to key theories and debates relating to national identity, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and class, particularly in relation to film. 

Small group teaching (seminars) will provide the students with the opportunity to discuss the films and topics individually and in small groups, and practice detailed analysis of film form. Larger workshops will further develop students’ ability to think comparatively, to apply theoretical concepts, to produce arguments, and to debate. Seminars and workshops take place in person, but could be scheduled online if necessary without undue disruption.

All knowledge outcomes are addressed by the combination of structured guided learning, scheduled learning and teaching activities, and guided independent study. All primary and secondary materials are available in English or with English subtitles.","Reflecting the module’s comparative spirit, assessments will require students to engage with films from different national contexts. The semester 1 24-hour exam will feature a choice of questions focusing on national identity. Students will be required to answer one of the questions by analysing at least two films from different national contexts. 

The semester 2 assessed essay will encourage students to develop their comparative analysis further still, by providing scope for the exploration of the relationship between national identity and other identity categories or debates through the comparative analysis of film. 
In both assessments, students will be required to pay attention to form as well as content and apply theoretical and contextual knowledge to produce nuanced comparative analyses of films, as practiced during seminars and workshops.

University of Newcastle,NU,Modern Languages,Inter-American Relations from the Spanish-American War (1898) to the end of the Cold War (1989/1991) (Inactive),20,Professor Jens R Hentschke,"In consonance with the degrees offered in the SML, this module aims:
•        to build on skills and knowledge gained at Stage 1.
•        to provide students with an in-depth knowledge of Inter-American Relations in the ‘short 20th century’ or the ‘age of extremes’ with its lasting legacies. 
•        to prepare students for for postgraduate study in the areas of Political Science/International Relations, Late Modern and Contemporary History and Politics, and Socio-Cultural Studies.
•        to make aspects of the above available to students from outside the degree.

The main purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to Inter-American relations in the 20th century, to understand the long-term consequences of U.S. foreign policy until the present time, and to combine three approaches:
a) International Relations Theory: you should understand the major paradigms, or normative ideas, and the inter-paradigmatic ‘Great Debates’ shaping this field and American foreign policy in the 20th century. Furthermore, you should recognise these ideas in political doctrines.
b) Historical Method of analysis and assessment of documents: you will get copies of primary sources in English, which reveal the objectives of U.S. foreign policy and the positions of Latin Americans.
c) Empirical case studies: you will test major theories, doctrines, development aid programmes, etc. by exploring some key events in U.S.-Latin American relations on the basis of the literature.

You will learn about the continuities (constant reinterpretations of the Monroe doctrine) and discontinuities (shift from isolationism to internationalism) in U.S. policy towards Latin America and get an idea of the cyclical character of inter-American relations. Periods of ‘realist’ (or even imperialist) US foreign policies and those of Washington’s benign neglect of Latin America have regularly replaced each other. The same applies to a U.S.-dominated Pan-Americanism and an integration of Latin American countries without or against, the U.S. (Latin Americanism).",,,,,,"In the planning session, students will be introduced to the intellectual and organisational design of the course, learn about the applied teaching methods and how to analyse primary sources, and hear about the formative and summative assessments. This will be followed by an material that highlights the history of Area Studies and International Relations, both born out of the ashes of World War I in North America, and the relation of these fields to the systematic disciplines. Students will then learn about the similarities and divergences in the historical and contemporary development of the approximately 30 nations of Latin America and thereby better understand the regional case studies that this course includes. Finally, they will be pointed to the significance of the ‘short twentieth century’ for explaining the current, ambiguous relationship between the US and Latin America. The core of the module focuses on six major periods of transformation in inter-American relations and explores the causes for critical realignments in the US, the doctrinal and policy changes they generated, and the effects they had on Latin America. When researching exemplary test cases, the interaction between the US and Latin America will be foregrounded. Online lectures will allow definition of the scope of the syllabus, an introduction to key terms and cases, and modelling of the analysis required (note taking). These materials, which deal with a complex matter, will remain part of the 33 contact hours. Students have expressed very high regard for these high-quality recordings because they can work through them in their own time and well in advance of the workshops and seminars, and this has also proven to be very beneficial for those with SSPs. Workshops and tutoring sessions will give students the opportunity to train hermeneutic skills in the interpretation of documentaries and key primary sources, while the seminars will help them consolidate their knowledge and apply a comparative approach.

The first four seminars will run every other week and the two last seminars every week. 

Lectures will provide the theoretical, conceptual, historical, artistic, and socio-political information and debates to introduce students to Latin American artistic production and theoretical thinking. Some lectures, particularly in section 2, will include 20 min presentations of key guest speakers and offer students the possibility to ask questions to Latin American art stakeholders. 

Lecture materials will introduce students to the topics discussed on each session. They will range from different sources and formats: texts, art works, exhibition websites, exhibition visits, interviews, and others. Students will have guiding questions to approach the readings and the other materials. Students will develop an individual first response and then they will expand their analysis in seminars. 

In seminars students will analyse the materials in detailed, led by questions given previously to guide the analysis, and in relation with aspects developed in lectures and with students’ own experiences and knowledges. Seminars will consist of student led-discussion fostering students’ critical thinking, formulation of arguments and ability for public presentation. Some discussion will be developed in smaller groups for students to engage in active discussions among them, work in a group answer and share it with the rest of the class developing teamwork and time management skills.","Online exhibition (40%): 
This assessment will be a group project based on an online exhibition of the topic in section 2. The exhibition will start to be developed in the last three seminars, particularly in those of curatorial activity and project. This exhibition has three aims: 1. To get a deeper understanding in the topic of section 2 by selecting and analysing specific art works and familiarising with artists’ trajectories. 2. To gain experience on how to develop a curatorial narrative and project (artworks, texts, space, sensory approach) by connecting a group of artworks and developing novel approaches and questions. 3. To reflect critically on the categories, narratives, and spatial distribution to be proposed for the exhibition. We will develop the online exhibition using Kunstmatrix or Omeka exhibition softwares. Both are easy to use and additional online tutorials will be added. The exhibition project will include shaping the exhibition concept, selecting the artworks, writing the curatorial exhibition text, deciding a title, writing about each individual work, writing a brief artists’ bios-trajectories; organising the artworks in the gallery online space; and developing a public programme (we will cover issues of budget, loans, transport, etc in lectures, however, the project will not include the development of these management aspects). Students will receive a group mark for the exhibition as a whole and will receive an individual mark based on the completion of their task for this assessment.      

Essay (60%):
This assessment consists of a 2200-word essay written in English about one of the theoretical, conceptual or historical topics analysed in section 1 of the module. Students will connect the discussion with specific case studies. The aim of this assessment is that students engage with larger debates and at the same time be able to analyse concrete practices, understanding the interrelations between the macro and micro, processes and practices, and developing a coherent and structured argument. Students will have to discuss their selected topic with the module leader by week 9. This assessment will help to develop students’ research and writing skills. 

Five responses/ reflections as Formative Assessments: 
Five responses submitted before each of the five first seminars. These responses can include the form of written texts of 250-300 words, conceptual maps, diagrams, drawings, or other forms. For the five responses two must be a 250-300 word written text, and the other three must take other forms. These are critical and reflective responses to the readings and activities planned for each seminar.

It will allow students to apply the critical skills acquired at stages one and two, plus the linguistic competence gained during the year abroad, to the study of the target culture. As they develop their analytical capacities, students will also gain a deeper understanding of Colombia's complex socio-cultural environment.

Constructed around the three main themes of race, class and gender, this module provides an in-depth introduction to cultural politics in Colombia. Students will study different forms of cultural production, ranging from telenovelas to reggaeton and from journalism to literature. In the process, they will gain insights into the complex socio-cultural mosaic that is Colombia today.",,,,,,"We adopt flexible, blended learning methods and strategies to introduce students to the analysis of the relationship between culture and politics in Colombia. Lectures, both in the form of present in person sessions (where practicable) and in the form of non-synchronous online teaching, will outline general principles, illustrated by specific examples, and be supplemented by structured independent reading and guided online learning activities. Small group teaching, noted above as synchronous present-in-person or, if necessary, online synchronous teaching, will allow students to examine cultural products and explore local contexts, allowing for detailed discussion and analysis as well as revisiting and reinforcing knowledge from the lecture materials and online guided activities. Seminars will provide the students with the opportunity to lead discussion on a topic through interactive activities that develop their independent thinking and critical analysis. Both types of learning activities will include advice on how to prepare for assessment.

i. Basic communication skills for coping with simple, though not completely stereotypical situations in
everyday life in the foreign country;
ii. More confidence than would be expected from beginners;
iii. A basic awareness of their own language learning strategies;
iv. A personal interest in the countries where the foreign language is spoken and their people;

Potentially this could include the Stoics, Epicureans, Sceptics, Cynics, and later Neo-Platonic Philosophy (Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, and others). Potentially, Jewish and Islamic thought of a similar period could also be introduced here, to further broaden the curriculum.

The module could involve a focus on questions of metaphysics, ethics, politics, or aesthetics, and would prolong the work its companion-module (Ancient Philosophy I) in continuing the story of how Philosophy grew more determinate and established as a discipline, in terms of the formation of its sub-disciplines, as occurred most impressively in the preserved works of Aristotle.

This lecture material will also be supplemented with online practise exercises for students to complete at their own pace. By completing both the lecture material and the exercises, students will gain an understanding of the importance of the skills they are developing and be able to practice those skills through repetition, which is appropriate to the development of key skills in informal logic, the identification of fallacies and the reconstruction, analysis and evaluation of argument. 

Workshops / seminars will incorporate both of these elements. They will encourage students to apply the skills they have learnt to ‘real life’ examples and provide a forum in which the importance of these skills and their relevance to academic practice can be explored.","The three-stage assessment will encourage engagement throughout the course of the module.

Behaviour is a product of influences from the individual’s genotype and from its environment; nature and nurture. These two influences interact in complex ways to influence behaviour throughout the individual’s lifetime.  The causal path from gene to behaviour is complex but we are beginning to unravel some of this complexity. Simple learning occurs by classical and instrumental conditioning, but birds and mammals are also capable of learning that may require more complex cognitive capabilities.

By the end of the module, students should have substantially greater insight into how the psychology of the individual contributes to the social world and how the social world contributes to the psychology of the individual.",,,,,,"The lecture materials provide an integrated and structured introduction to research and theory on each topic. Although students will be encouraged to ask questions and open up some level of discussion, the small group sessions will give them a greater opportunity to discuss specific areas of the course material. In the small group sessions, students will be required to discuss and think critically about research findings.  The private study time will allow students to carry out in depth review of the information imparted through lecture materials, to consolidate their learning and to generate their own views on the topics. These views can then be followed up with further reading from the extended reading list, and discussed in the small group sessions.
In order to maintain the core learning outcomes of the module that centre on discursive essay writing and theory understanding, an online essay workshop is maintained. Students write a formative mock essay exam and then engage in peer marking using the UG assessment criteria. In addition, in order to meet the learning outcomes for content coverage, weekly formative activities take the form of a student-led journal club with discussion activities. The formative discussion activities can be done in groups or individually via short reflective statements through an online discussion forum.","One of the main functions of this module is to provide experience of exam essay writing and discursive argument. Therefore, this module has an unseen essay to ensure that students have sufficient experience of exam writing in preparation for stage 3. The module also shares an essay writing workshop which is run in collaboration with PSY2001 Developmental Psychology. The workshop provides formative feedback on essay writing via peer marking and informal feedback.

The written examination is used to assess: knowledge, independent learning and understanding of material relevant to the module; gathering of information from a variety of sources; understanding and application of theoretical concepts; critical evaluation of arguments and evidence; the ability to communicate effectively in writing; understanding and articulation of critical issues in psychology; the ability for critical thought and original approach. In line with BPS requirements, the MCQ exam tests subject knowledge on a broad range of topics and concepts.

(a)        validity and reliability in the measurement of individual differences;
(b)        the major theories of individual differences (especially the five factor model of personality and 
        theories of intelligence)
(c)        integrating correlational research with genetics and neurobiology
(d)        the relationships between individual differences, health and psychopathology",,,,,,"The lectures, module talk and readings form the core factual content of the course. Students will participate in a practical session where they will gain experience administering a number of personality tasks and neuropsychological tests of intelligence . During this session, students will be asked to reflect on and to discuss the strengths and weakness of the different tasks. This practical is designed to assist their understanding of the methods to study both individual differences in personality and intelligence, and to assist the preparation of their coursework assessment where they must “devise a novel assessment tool for measuring one (or more) personality trait/s”, This assessment will enhance learning outcomes and develop insight into how psychological measurement tools are constructed. The presentation mode (i.e. video essay) has been selected to enhance student engagement and to encourage critical and creative thinking.

Due to the novel presentation mode, students will also take part in an IT workshop (to support their use of animation and/or presentation software) and two small group sessions designed to support them throughout the preparation of their coursework and to provide students with the opportunity to receive formative feedback from their peers at timely intervals during the preparation of their assignments. In addition, the module leader and postgraduate student demonstrators will support peer discussions. Students will be required submit a short written reflection on each session. Students will be encouraged to submit this by the end of the week in which the small group teaching session was held. Failure to submit a reflection by 4.30pm on the Friday afternoon will result in a categorical mark being deducted from their final grade (one categorical mark for each reflection not submitted). If a student is unable to attend a session for an authorised reason, they will be encouraged to submit their preparatory work for the session, along with their own reflection on their work. If this is completed, no penalty will be applied. Additional optional drop-in surgeries will provide additional coursework assessment support. This process is designed to further enhance the learning outcomes of this module and to provide students with the experience of developing a research idea and a corresponding experimental design, prior to the commencement of their Stage 3 project.","Individual differences in intelligence: assessed using an online timed synchronous computer based MCQ (remote) examination in which student will answer 15 multiple-choice questions. Multiple choice examinations are regularly used in Psychology Stage 2 modules and care is taken to ensure that the questions are of varying levels of difficulty and assess understanding as well as factual recall. Online quizzes provide formative feedback to students. 

Individual differences in personality: assessed using a coursework assessment that is supported by small-group teaching sessions and multiple drop-in surgeries to provide formative feedback to students. This assessment has multiple elements: a video essay (audio-visual format) 5-6 minute duration, a written audio script, a written description of the task protocol, a reference section and reflective logs. 

The video essay will be used to assess knowledge and understanding of the material relevant to this component of the module, along with ability for critical thinking within a psychological context (which includes consideration of ethical issues surrounding psychological testing). It will also assess ability to communicate ideas clearly – both visually and verbally - and in a way which is not currently assessed in any other psychology module (and will hence extend the range of graduate skills developed during the degree programme). Students will have the opportunity to receive formative feedback on their assignments at the online synchronous small group teaching sessions and at the online synchronous drop-in surgeries that will run throughout the semester. They will also attend an IT workshop to enhance their knowledge of presentation and animation software, and a workshop designed to offer practical experience with existing measures of personality and intelligence. This process is designed to further enhance the learning outcomes of this module and to provide students with the experience of developing a research idea and a corresponding experimental design, prior to the commencement of their Stage 3 project. 

Reflective Logs: Following both small group teaching sessions, students will submit a brief written description (~300 words), reflecting on the formative feedback received in each session (see ‘Rationale of Teaching Methods and relationship to Learning Outcomes’ for further details. A final written reflective log (word limit = 500 words) will be submitted upon completion of the assignment. Students will be encouraged to reflect back on their summary notes submitted after the small group teaching sessions when completing the reflective log of their learning journey. 

The reflective logs will provide a forum for students to reflect on what they have learnt in the process of researching and completing their assignment, enabling them, as learners, to gain a better understanding of their learning journey. These logs will also provide the module leader with insights into the student voice and will enable modifications to be made to the assignment in order to enhance future students learning experiences. 

Failure to submit a reflection after each session (i.e. by 4.30pm on the Friday afternoon of the week in which each small group teaching sessions took place will result in a categorical mark being deducted from their final grade for the video-essay component (one categorical mark for each reflection not submitted).

Recent research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience highlights the foundational role of interoception, i.e. the perception of internal bodily signals, and the appraisal of those for cognition, emotion and behaviour. Students will be introduced to how awareness of bodily signals links to the sense of an embodied self, mental health and its disorders. Bringing together cognitive and clinical psychology this module aims to further students understanding of the body-mind interactions with the theoretical models that underpin them for both basic and applied areas in Psychology. Students will gain conceptual knowledge about how bodily signals and the representation of those link to the capacity to contribute to one’s own wellbeing and regulative behaviour. Students will also be equipped with practical knowledge about tools to foster this link in order to prevent and alleviate physical and mental disease for themselves and others.",,,,,,"The chosen teaching methods encourage students to take an active role in their learning experience. A module talk will introduce the module structure, outline its relevance for academic psychology and for applied/therapeutic practice. Lecture materials will impart information and ensure students will engage with relevant literature and research such that students can apply what they have learned from guided independent study and course work. Relevant research papers and instruments will be appraised in order to deepen understanding of the learning content and foster independent critical thinking. Activities and peer-reviewed formative activities will entail group work for  students to develop their collaborative working skills and encourage them to negotiate and build relationships with others. In addition to this two workshops will be held and will also include an element of group work dedicated to the preparation of the final assessment.  

The practical sessions entail research-led teaching enabling the students to track changes in their ability to be interoceptively aware using the MAIA (see syllabus section). A reflective journal is kept documenting if and how their changes in interoceptive awareness relate to an increase in capacity to contribute to their wellbeing. For skill development, students will learn how to design and instruct a tool to foster body awareness in others. 

Students will be expected to complete guided independent study in order to help them prepare for lectures, tutorials, and practical sessions and will be encouraged to further their own specific interests in body-mind interactions and their link to basic and applied aspects in psychology.","Working towards in-depth comprehension and the skills-based module aim, 100% of the overall grade for this module will come from a research report based on self-reflection and pre-post measures of their interoceptive awareness. 

Students will complete the MAIA (see syllabus section) at the beginning and the end of the semester. The report will be written in APA style presenting existing literature on the topic combined with examples/evidence from their own experiences documented in their diary. 

There will be two workshops with group work activities in preparation for the final assessment. The first workshop will be dedicated to the analyses of the MAIA scores, writing time, issues about the write up and the marking criteria. Students will work in small groups to exchange ideas and address issues. General issues will also be discussed in the larger group. In between workshops students will exchange reports with approx. 2-3 others to gain peer-reviewed feedback in the second workshop. Here, students will work in small groups to give and receive feedback and work on the final draft. 

This choice assesses the students’ understanding of the learning content and evaluates the learning outcomes accordingly. The research report and formative presentation will cover the theoretical approaches/models of interoception and its role for psychological functions (knowledge outcomes 1-3). The report represents an appraisal of the MAIA in relation to attention, emotion and self-regulation based on self-experience after a short-term intervention which will be linked to existing studies on interoceptive awareness and mental health (knowledge outcomes 4-6). The assessment requires both discerning and synthesising knowledge acquired over the course of the module and communication of such. 

The research report and formative presentation of research papers will require clear articulation of the knowledge outcomes in oral/written form, respectively (skill outcome 1) as well as measure the ability to describe, interpret and appraise research on interception (skill outcome 2). The research report deepens the understanding of the learning material and transfers it into both research as well as clinical practice. This choice of assessment will enable the students to measure and track their ability to make use of bodily signals to establish a stronger internal locus of health control through the applied short-term intervention (skill outcomes 3-4). This self-experience will assist in designing prevention/intervention tools for practice-based settings (skill outcome 5).

University of Newcastle,NU,Psychology,To Cheat or not to Cheat: The Evolution of Cooperative Behaviour,10,Dr Billie Moffat-Knox,"The aims of this module are:
to show how cooperation is a fundamental aspect of human and animal nature;
to show how disciplines ranging from economics to evolutionary psychology can contribute to understanding cooperation;
to provide an understanding of how and why individuals cooperate with each other;
to use cooperation as a model for understanding the roles of mechanistic and functional explanations of behaviour;
and to use cooperation as a model for appreciating the various moral, ethical and practical issues surrounding appropriate research methods;


Summary:
Cooperative behaviours range from helpful acts to costly altruism. Human cooperation is complex; we donate blood to strangers and feel good when ‘unfair’ cheats are punished. Non-human animals also regularly engage in cooperation, for example vampire bats will share blood with non-relatives in need of food. Philosophers and scientists have grappled with the problems of cooperation for millennia but we now know cooperation has played a prominent role in the evolution of life. The module uses an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the evolution of cooperation; perspectives include paleoanthropology, psychology, and behavioural economics. The behavioural ecology of cooperation in other animals is drawn on to show the evolutionary origins of cooperation in humans. The course provides a close link between research and teaching by drawing on the latest advances, including work carried out in the department.",,,,,,"Weekly 2-hour present in person lectures are used as the primary and most effective mode of imparting the core knowledge of the module. They consist of a one hour lecture, followed immediately by a one-hour small group teaching session. The two hour session will include interactive materials (such as recall of cheaters’ faces and playing economic games) to enhance the student experience. These sessions are also used to discuss reading material set using curated reading tasks (academic skills activities), and debate current issues in cooperation research(ranging from the ethical to the theoretical). These sessions enrich core module knowledge by incorporating hands on experience. Subject to social distancing guidelines, the seminar series may also consist of an external seminar (fieldwork); following an appropriate risk assessment by the module leader, students will engage in field observations of a human or non-human animal cooperative behaviour while using an ethogram and then discuss their findings in relation to the module’s knowledge and skills outcomes. The private study is essential for in depth review of knowledge imparted during lectures and is essential for an upper 2.1 or first class mark.","The written examination is used to assess knowledge, independent learning and understanding of material relevant to the module (Intended Knowledge Outcomes 1-5), the ability to integrate this material and to communicate it clearly, as well as the ability for critical thought and originality of approach (Intended Skills Outcomes 1-3). 

Formative Assessment
The formative assessment involves writing an essay from a choice of past exam questions.  Feedback from the module leader will use the marking criteria to tell students where they have met the criteria for a particular mark and which criteria they have not satisfied in order to improve their mark.

Students can also gain formative feedback on their learning of the assessed knowledge and skills throughout the course. Formative feedback is primarily given by the module leader in the interactive sessions, but also includes formative feedback from peers in the interactive sessions.  Formative feedback will be provided for intended skills outcome 4 via a class discussion of ethograms and their use following the fieldwork component.

(1) Introduce students to the principles and methods of neuropsychology
(2) Introduce case studies as an experimental approach
(3) Demonstrate how the damaged brain in combination with recent brain imaging techniques can inform about cognitive functions in areas such as vision, language, motor control and conscious awareness
(4) Develop critical analysis  and oral communication skills

Summary:
This module introduces students to the growing field of neuropsychology which examines the relationship between brain structures and functions such as vision, language, motor control, and conscious awareness. As the title suggests, the module focuses on (1) how brain damage leads to deficits in these functions, and (2) how case studies can inform researchers about how the brain works in neurologically healthy people. For example, in prosopagnosia, lesions to the temporal lobes can lead to a profound inability to visually recognize faces (even of the individual’s own face!) but with no impaired vision. Students will critically examine neurological case studies, and learn how this method complements more recent brain imaging techniques in both healthy and damaged brains.",,,,,,"The lectures, workshops and practical are needed to discuss the underlying principles and methodology of neuropsychology (ILO 1-4).

- Enable students to understand key  developmental disorders that can disrupt typical development and their impact upon psychological functioning. 
- Introduce students to the main methods used in the psychological study of disorders of development.
- Improve understanding of not only atypical developmental processes but also typical pathways of development.
- Enable students to compare and contrast the psychological profiles of individuals with different disorders of development.
- Utilise a variety of teaching methods, including encouraging interaction and discussion during lectures",,,,,,"Lectures will introduce core concepts for the study of disorders of development. Throughout the module students will gain an insight into the diverse nature of disorders of development that will allow them to think critically about the possible differences between a-typically developing populations. Lectures will be supported by seminars in which students will work in small groups to complete tasks and answer questions, and there will be structured reading activities and formative quizzes on Canvas. 

Private and self study is encouraged to think critically about published research exploring cognition and behavioural phenotypes associated with disorders of development, and to prepare for and complete the coursework and end of semester exam. Students will also have the chance to submit a practice essay for feedback, and workshops will allow for formative feedback on critical evaluation in relation to the coursework assignment.","Written Examination:

The unseen examination will show if students have managed to extract and combine the relevant information presented across various lectures in order to formulate a coherent ‘story’ or ‘argument’. The  questions are designed so that a satisfactory answer cannot be achieved by focusing on only one disorder of development, but they require the student to pull together / compare / contract aspects of different disorders of development. 

Coursework Essay::

Students will complete a critical assessment of a published paper. The critical assessment coursework essay will allow students the opportunity to illustrate how they have mastered the main methodological challenges arising in this field of investigation. Three questions will be asked and students will be required to evaluate aspects of the i) introduction / rationale, ii) method / design and iii) results / conclusions. Each answer must be a maximum of 500 words (the full written exercise will be a maximum of 1500 words).


These methods of assessment (an exam plus coursework essay) support student learning by encouraging wider reading / critical analysis skills and assimilation of arguments based on theory and evidence.

The workshops will give students the opportunity to apply their knowledge of the main themes presented in the module as well as contemporary topics in forensic psychology to an applied task and develop the outcome skills necessary for that task. Students will also explore the workshop topics from a practitioner standpoint to examine the functionality of certain tasks and any associated issues or challenges.

The contact time for this module reflects the amount of preparation students are expected to do for the assessment.","The group presentation will develop their skills to work collaboratively towards a common goal and will provide students an opportunity to articulate their understanding of a topic. It will also develop their written and oral presentation skills as well as critical formulation and evaluation of the topic question.

The final assessment is a 1500-word report answering one of three predetermined topic questions. Students will be expected to demonstrate the ability to critically evaluate the topic and provide their own supported and evidenced views on the subject. Finally, an assessment of this nature provides the student with an opportunity to articulate their comprehension of the main themes and topics presented throughout the module.

Seminars will also include revision preparation, a practice exam and general Q and A.","Formative assessment

Essay exam practice: Essay outlines will be produced under exam conditions in response to exam question examples; essay plans will be presented to the group as a whole. Other example essay plans are available on the VLE. The lecturer then verbally reviews the marking scheme used for these essays. The activity provides learners with the experience of planning and writing exam essays and of comparing their answers to the marking schemes.

Formative online learning activities: These are graduated written exercises completed via Qualtrics/Canvas to consolidate lecture content and prepare for the exam - automated feedback is provided immediately on completion of each exercise, and longer verbal feedback is provided in the seminar sessions. These informal formative assessments allow learners to consolidate key lecture content around central critical evaluative themes.

Summative assessment

In the final examination, students will be presented with two unseen essays (two questions from an open choice of six). This will allow students to demonstrate both factual knowledge, and – by their organization of material – abstract systematic understanding of topics related to key issues in eating and weight disorders research in an objective and rigorous manner. Each essay should take approximately 1 hour to complete.
Marks will be equally distributed between the two essays.

Students are expected to be independent, critical and pragmatic, taking more responsibility for their own learning and skill development (characteristic of Stage 3).","Summative assessment of this module consists of two components:

The first component (50%) is an essay (1500 words) that will require the student to critically evaluate the efficacy of physical activity as a treatment for a range of mental health conditions. The essay is used to assess knowledge, independent learning and understanding of material relevant to the module, the ability to integrate this material and to communicate it clearly in writing, as well as the ability for critical thought and originality of approach. In addition, the essay assesses the skills of analysis and reasoning (Intended Knowledge Outcome 1; Intended Skill Outcome 1 & 2).

The second component (50%) is a case study (1500 words) that will provide students with a real life scenario from a sport or exercise setting concerning an individual experiencing a significant mental health condition that is having an ongoing negative effect on their psychological health and well-being. The case study is intended to ensure that the students can utilise their theoretical knowledge in an applied context to design and evaluate the outcome of a psychological intervention based upon an appropriate psychological theory/model. (Intended Knowledge Outcome 2 & 3; Intended Skill Outcome 2 &3).

The module will also afford students the opportunity for formative feedback.

The interactive workshop sessions will allow further discussion of concepts taught via the lecture material and give the opportunity for students to engage in course material through taking part in small scale psychological experiments, critiquing psychological theories of addiction, and discussing contemporary research and treatments. A series of case studies presented in the workshops will also allow students to gain important perspectives on addiction and substance use disorders. Workshops will also provide a springboard to discuss research methods and treatments in addiction grounded in realistic and applied examples. Use of face-to-face group discussions and classroom polling throughout the course will further facilitates student interactions and provides ample opportunities to learn about the essay questions which might be used in the final summative assignment (formative practice).

The early weeks of teaching will be double lectures from the module leader. We then move to a series of weeks with a balance of occasional single lectures and student-led seminars. Student small groups (3-4 in each) will develop a tool / learning resource or intervention based on the theoretical knowledge of sensory processing difficulties.  

The module leader will introduce the main topic areas, and will set the students tasks of integrating material across different approaches. Interactive discussion will aid them in developing their ideas for designing a tool / resource, and in preparation for their poster presentations. The poster presentation, which will form 30% of the assessed component of the module evaluation, will be an important means of testing the knowledge and skills outcomes for this module.

Unseen examination (answer two essay-based exam questions from choice of five. All questions will be set to require use of material beyond a single lecture delivered by the Module leader to gain a high mark)

Formative Assessment:
The poster presentation will be by a small group of students (3-4)
This formative assessment will give students the opportunity to focus their interest of one area of the course content and give them experience in poster presentation. 

Assessment rationale and relationship:
The poster presentation will  develop knowledge and skills outcomes – synthesising information, innovation through design, research of current literature, team working, communication and presentation skills. 

The unseen examination will mainly assess the knowledge outcomes.


These methods of assessment (an exam plus poster presentation) support student learning by encouraging wider reading / critical analysis skills and assimilation of arguments based on theory and evidence.

They will also provide references to other materials useful for developing a greater depth of understanding of the topics covered. The lectures further afford opportunities to seek clarification and to ask questions relating to the course. 

Small group teaching sessions provide opportunities to dive deeper into the issues and concepts presented in the lectures. Students may be required to prepare for these by reading one or two pre-specified papers; the sessions will then allow for discussion and exchange of ideas (Knowledge Outcomes 2 and 3; Skills Outcome 1). Example Topics covered include the efficacy of using a range of different research methodologies, ethical practices in science, and how to design studies to examine the effects of prenatal sex hormones. Students will also have opportunities to evaluate/critique each other’s essay plans (Skills Outcome 2), and to deliver short conference-style presentations in small groups (Skills Outcome 3). These activities will help prepare students for the assessments encountered later in the course (Skills Outcome 4).

Directed research and reading is used to point students in the direction of important learning materials.

It also provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their academic writing skills, as well as their abilities to critically evaluate studies and theories, and to synthesise findings from the research literature. Development of these skills can be important for a range of settings, such as when undertaking clinical training or postgraduate study.

The poster presentation is a formative assessment that will be used to develop students’ abilities to create and present a conference-style research poster. It also provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subjects discussed, as the presentations may encourage questions and discussion.

2)        facilitating critical evaluation of research methods and findings
3)        encouraging students to consider the real-world implications of the research and how to communicate these to a variety of audiences. 

The module will use an interdisciplinary approach, with topics and perspectives spanning developmental and comparative psychology, anthropology, biology, and neuroscience.",,,,,,"The weekly lectures will provide students with key background information, including the theoretical drives and research methods of each relevant topic (knowledge outcomes 1-4). Lectures will introduce key papers and act as a guide for the students’ independent reading. Small group work will centre around a more focused discussion of two or three key papers (either drawing different conclusions on the same topic or employing different experimental methods). Students will be asked to engage in exchanges/debates exploring these differences. This will help achieve critical analysis of the material, as well as presentation skills (skills outcome 1-3). Both lectures and small group work will provide a venue for students to ask questions, engage with the material, and build upon key skills. If the public health situation permits, students will embark on a field-trip to collect social observations on humans and other animals.  Alternatively, behavioural observations will be made from video recordings of animals in wild and captive settings.  Students will develop ethograms for this based on discussions during small group teaching sessions and on their own through independent study.  Students will present their ethograms and the results of their observational data collection in small groups in class.  Verbal feedback will be given by the module leader and their peers.

The aim of this module is to provide a structured and theoretically sound approach to enhance students understanding of the contemporary approaches and processes involved in applied performance sport psychology (e.g. motivation, confidence, team dynamics, emotion regulation). Students should demonstrate an appreciation of historical perspectives and evidence but also demonstrate their enhanced understanding of advancements in research within the extant sport psychology literature.",,,,,,"Weekly lecture materials and academic skills activities will provide students with an understanding of the core topics and include relevant theory and contemporary research. Students will have the opportunity to engage with real-world problem-based case studies from which these theories can be applied and evidence informed judgements can be undertaken regarding the efficacy of such theories and their utility. The topics covered within the module provide a breadth of learning experiences via interactive lecture materials, practical tasks and debates. There will also be opportunities for the students to engage in tasks which will provide formative practice and feedback for the group and individual assessments.  This will include looking at magazine articles from psychology publications, discussion of assessment plans and a mock evaluation of a sporting organisation.  The module may also be supplemented with applied perspectives provided by guest speakers and/or practitioners.","The presentation provides an appropriate method for assessing the students’ ability to plan and prepare and deliver an oral presentation, which addresses one of the skill outcomes for the module. It has been widely acknowledged across the discipline of sport psychology that students should have an awareness of sporting organisations, how performance psychologists are integrated within organisations and have an understanding of ethical considerations. The presentation provides the platform for students to demonstrate all of these considerations and provide an oral articulation of their understanding.  An individual and group mark will be awarded.  Assessment of each individual student will be marked on personal presentation style and presentation format and the quality of content; The group mark will consider overall critical content, team work, innovation and creativity, presentation flow. The individual and group marks are weighted equally and combined into a single categorical mark per student and this will comprise 30% of the module assessment. 


The written magazine article provides an appropriate way to assess students’ knowledge and understanding of a contemporary area of performance sport psychology. Students will be expected to provide a critical evaluation of theories and relevant research studies to inform their article. Moreover, they will also be expected to include a section within their article that is specifically directed to articulating their findings to a lay audience (such as a coach, athlete or parent) which is an essential skill in applied practice.

They also provide opportunities for students to seek clarification and will expose students to a variety of social psychological studies and designs that can be utilised to study prejudice. Lectures will also introduce students to theoretical debate, e.g. over the effectiveness of modern techniques in prejudice reduction as well as conceptual arguments as to what implicit tests actually measure.

Workshops: These sessions will allow the students the opportunity to build on the aforementioned intended skills outcomes through a more hands-on approach as well as via deeper discussion of theory from an applied perspective. Students will gain practical skills related to social psychology methodologies in practical sessions, e.g. they will gain hands on experience of using reaction time software as well as more traditional experimental methods using questionnaires. For the former, students will learn how to modify existing software to fit with their research design. Students will also be introduced to resources that allow them to create a simple experimental task, e.g. the Stroop task. For the latter, students will use the workshops to understand how social psychologists assess blatant prejudice. Students can also use the workshops to discuss findings from recent and seminal research papers and apply these findings in a real-world context.","The summative assessment consists of an examination worth 80% and a Poster worth 20%.

The written (unseen) exam will assess the students’ ability to critically evaluate the material and write academically. To do well, students will have to synthesise material from across the module, both the theoretical and applied aspects, rather than focusing on one lecture topic. The use of a seen exam allows for deeper critical evaluation of the key theories and concepts introduced. In part 1 of the written exam, students will answer 1 question from a choice of three, thereby ensuring that have sufficient knowledge of both traditional approaches to the study of prejudice in addition to novel implicit methods. In part 2 of the written exam, students design a novel task and complete a mock pre-registration protocol. Students will need to think of a novel study design and consider in detail how the study would be conducted, e.g. specific predictions, measures to be used, sample size requirements, and statistical analysis. It is not necessary for students to memorise exact values (e.g. with regards to statistical calculations) but they do need to offer a rationale for their choices. 

Prior to the pre-registration protocol written exam, students will engage in formative group work that will provide a more realistic view of working on a research project and encourage collaborative thinking and discussion. Each group will complete a pre-registration protocol template that introduces key aspects of research design that need to be considered before data collection. Students will be given a template of an open science framework protocol and work together to design a novel study related to prejudice and discrimination. This formative task allows for creativity as students can choose a topic of study that they find compelling. The use of group work allows for the pre-registration protocol to be divided into separate areas of responsibility if necessary. Students that are unable to work in groups may submit the task independently if necessary; however, group work is encouraged as this simulates a real-world research environment. 

Students will also work in small groups on a formative assessment to create or modify an experimental reaction time task using open source software. Groups will submit a working software test and receive formative feedback.  Students are encouraged to be creative and design a novel task based on recent research in the field. Each group is required to submit a working version of their task.  Each individual student is required to submit a summative poster that explains their design choice.  This assessment introduces students to the concept of designing an implicit task and will give students hand on experience of using reaction time software.

Some time will also be spent on linking that information to the evolution of behaviour.

Students will then be asked to apply this knowledge to a behaviour or neurobiological mechanism of their choice, and write a coherent integrative report on how this behaviour or mechanism has evolved. In order to facilitate them doing this, they will be presented with example case studies. This will allow them to see different approaches to this integration and to improve their understanding of the concepts of how brains and behaviour evolve. It will also allow them to practice the critical evaluation of the evidence in this field.","The formative assessment requires the student to submit an outline essay with a list of papers to show that there is sufficient literature of the different types on the chosen subject to all a good literature review to be written. This allows the student to evaluate their approach to the literature review and allows the module leader to re-direct the student’s efforts to a better topic should not enough appropriate literature exist or should the topic not fit the subject of the module.

The literature review requires to student to show their understanding of the different components of the evolution of brain and behaviour, and requires them to synthesize the information into a coherent narrative.

Structured research and reading activities: These activities will allow the students the opportunity to build on the 4 knowledge outcomes through deeper discussions/debates of specific topics, all of which will help students to design their research proposals. Additionally, these will allow students to develop the skills listed above. 

Practical workshops: 
Students will gain practical skills related to olfactory and gustatory methodologies and assessment methods (skill 4). Time will also be devoted to the practical aspects of designing research proposals and generating hypotheses (skill 1) which is of direct benefit to the module assessment. All of the skills developed here are directly related to the design of a research proposal, and thus will guide the students through completing this assessment.


Skills practice: Students will be given the opportunity to evaluate the work of their peers and receive feedback on their own work (skills 2 and 4, students are allocated guided independent study time to prepare for this).","The research proposal will be used to assess the students’ knowledge and theoretical understanding of the course material, their academic writing skills, and their ability to critically evaluate the literature. It also allows them to demonstrate their ability to synthesise information from the literature and generate novel hypotheses, and combine this with their knowledge of olfactory and gustatory research methods – all of which will be necessary for designing a research proposal.

The formative peer assessment of their research proposal idea will allow the students to practice their evaluative skills and will also present them with the opportunity to gain useful feedback on their own proposals. Students will record a 1 minute “pitch” of their proposal idea. Students will then be asked to review 4 peer videos and give written constructive feedback (minimum of 150 words). 

The practical workshops will allow students to develop skills in administering tests of sensory perception. Students will select two sensory assessment methods  completed in these workshops which they will use to complete a structured reflective log which will be a graded component of the course, and understanding of these methods will enable students to consider and evaluate methods for the completion of the research proposal.

University of Newcastle,NU,Psychology,Transpersonal Psychology: Mindfulness and Psychological Well-Being.,20,Mr Michael Atkinson,"The module aims at introducing students to emerging fields of Psychology and their enquiry related to psychological well-being. Furthermore, the course aspires to enhance students’ critical awareness of modern psychological perspectives and interventions that are aimed toward the maintenance and enhancement of psychological well-being, with a particular focus on transpersonal approaches and mindfulness in the form of the 8-Week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course, which is an internationally recognised evidence-based programme. This is currently offered to all staff and students at the University.

The module will couple lecture materials with practical sessions which entail a strong applied focus. Thus, students will be provided with the opportunity to develop a personal practice of mindfulness (MBSR) for both their own personal development and to deepen an experiential understanding of alternative perspectives on psychological well-being, particularly those that stem from the fields of transpersonal psychology and contemplative traditions that incorporate meditative practices such as mindfulness and yoga-based movement.",,,,,,"This module combines research with an experiential approach to learning. In addition to exploring the theoretical components of Eastern philosophical and spiritual traditions as encapsulated in the field of Transpersonal Psychology and modern secular mindfulness, students will also have the opportunity to partake in an 8-week course in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). This combination of theory and practice is intended to enhance students’ critical awareness of modern psychological interventions that are aimed toward the enhancement and maintenance of psychological well-being. The introduction of an alternative and emerging field of enquiry will provide a new lens through which modern psychological theory and practice can be critically evaluated.


Students will become acquainted with theory and learn practical skills through a series of lectures, seminars and workshops. The workshops are particularly focussed on students developing a personal practice. Lectures, seminars and additional online learning opportunities will aid reflective and collaborative learning.  Such interpersonal processes aim to facilitate the acquirement of theoretical and practical knowledge in order to achieve the learning outcomes. 

A blended approach will be used to ensure that the course can flex to any changing circumstances. The MBSR programme will be entirely online, bar an optional retreat half or full-day which offers face-to-face contact (given lack of restrictions - otherwise will be run online). Lectures and seminars will be a mix of online (via Canvas) and face-to-face provision.","There will be two forms of summative assessment for this 20 credit module. 

Working towards the in-depth self-experiential and the skills-based module aim, 80% of the overall grade for this module will come from a reflective essay and 20% from an oral presentation  . The reflective essay will be based on the analyses and synthesis of the student’s weekly reflections (log submitted as annex to final essay) and self-reported data from completed pre- and post-course scales in order to identify, discuss and evaluate key areas of personal development taking into account relevant literature.  

The report will be written in APA style (1500  words, reflective journal as appendix). Two of the lectures/seminars will be held in workshop form for group work activities and preparation for final assessment. The first workshop will be dedicated to the analyses of the self-report measures, writing time, issues about the write up and the marking criteria. Students will work in small groups to exchange ideas and address issues. General issues will also be discussed in the larger group. In between workshops students will exchange reports with approx. 2-3 others to gain peer-reviewed feedback in the second workshop (part of formative assessment). Here, student will work in small groups to give and receive feedback and work on the final draft.

For the five- minute presentation the student will be asked to elaborate and appraise how his/her learning from the module is relevant for future studies and/or a professional practice within the field of psychology or other fields and present an example of a key aspect of learning and how it may apply. This will be in the form of a dialogue rather than a didactic presentation.

These assessment choices assess the students’ understanding of the learning content and evaluates the learning outcomes accordingly. The research report will cover relevant psychological models and their differing perspectives on mental health and psychological ill versus well-being (knowledge outcomes 1-3). The report and the presentation represent an appraisal of one’s capacity to reflect insightfully into psychological processes and the translation of theoretical models into meaningful self-development and other applied contexts (knowledge outcomes 4-6)

Both assessments will require the student to demonstrate an expanded awareness about how individual and group-based experiential learning is applied to and meaningfully recognised for both personal/self-related issues and professional life, including working relationships and/or clinical practice (skill outcomes 1-4). Both assessments will require communication about the understanding and management of complex psychological processes (skill outcomes 5-6).

The module will: integrate economic, psychological, neurobiological, and evolutionary approaches to understanding how humans make choices; examine the mechanisms shaping various facets of decision-making; and examine the evolutionary function of these processes; assess the real-world consequences of decision-making in terms of wealth, health, and well-being. In doing so, this module aims to develop students’ knowledge and understanding of human decision-making and their ability to apply an interdisciplinary approach to new problems.",,,,,,"The intended knowledge outcomes will be met primarily through lecture content and associated set reading. Students will then be asked to apply their knowledge to an aspect of decision-making of their choice, to create a coherent integrative presentation of how this decision aspect has evolved, as well as how it varies – or not – across human societies. Before the presentation, they will also be asked to create an abstract of their presentation. This will allow them to apply evolutionary thinking and a cross-cultural perspective to decision-making. It will also allow them to synthesize empirical research from different disciplines and to practice their communication skills.","The formative assessment and feedback are aimed at giving students the opportunity to practice the skills necessary to search, select and use literatures relevant for the assessment. 

The in-course abstract assessment is aimed at practicing the ability to synthesize and explain concisely empirical research. Then, the individual presentation is aimed at developing oral presentation skills. For both assessments, students will be expected to demonstrate the ability to integrate cross-cultural and comparative literature to discuss how a specific aspect of human economic decision-making have evolved and vary across human societies.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/biomed/psy/,

iv.        What constitutes an explanation of brain function?
v.        Get to know simple, yet influential paradigmatic examples",,,,,,"The initial lectures will be used to convey the basic knowledge, historical background, and key concepts about brain function from a biological and philosophical perspective. The latter will naturally lead into an introduction of neural accounts of the mind/brain and cognition/behaviour. These introductory lectures will set the stage for an in-depth exploration of the components that are needed to understand and develop the notion of a representational and computational account of the brain/mind. Following this groundwork, the ideas will be applied to several model systems (paradigmatic examples), and it will be explored how the emerging view (emerging during the progression of the module that is) can be used to frame behaviour, cognition, neurological disorders and neuropsychological findings.

Finally, students will also participate in a demonstration session (during the lecture hours of a lecture late in the module) in the computer lab, where they can run a few pre-programmed models under the guidance of the module leader, to observe the process of using models first-hand. This session will not be exam-relevant but will allow for a hands-on experience of how the approach that is taught in the module can be implemented in the real world.","In the mid module coursework assignment students will then be asked to apply their knowledge to create a poster on a specific topic or published paper. This will be the first summative assessment and will assess key skill outcomes Guidance, templates and software will be provided.

University of Newcastle,NU,Biomedical Sciences,Essential Biomedical Research Skills,20,Dr Vanessa Armstrong,This module aims to give students a broad understanding of the principles underpinning techniques commonly used within biosciences as well as develop skills competence in molecular biology techniques. Students will learn how to utilise informatics and statistical software alongside technical theory to interpret results/data. An awareness and understanding  of health and safety and ethical issues associated with scientific research will also be covered.,,,,,,"The didactic lecture is still the most efficient means of providing knowledge of method principles (K1, K2) and concepts in ethics (K3). 

Practical strand A:
Basic experience and practical competence in the core molecular techniques is important to all students irrespective of the degree programme (S1).  Emphasis will be made on the link between techniques by investigating a putative gene that has sequence similarity to other proteins involved in transmembrane transport (K1).  The techniques progress from isolation of genetic material, engineering genes into plasmids and transformation of organisms to produce the protein product.  Characterisation of the protein, expression, identification and quantification follow (S2). 

Ethics strand B:
Ethics surrounding scientific research influences all areas of science and is therefore important to all degree programmes (K3). Lectures provide the most efficient means of providing information about ethics. This is supported by a seminar session to facilitate interactive debate and better prepare the student for the assessment. 

Informatics strand C:
Although frequently referred to as bioinformatics, the module does look at wider informatics (S3).  BLAST searching and interpretation of results on several commonly used bioinformatics websites provides students with sufficient knowledge to use the tools without becoming bioinformaticians.  The need to revisit the avoidance of plagiarism is timely at this point as students start to write more essays and gain a better understanding of scientific writing (S4). ‘Cloud-based’ documents and databases are increasingly popular and will be used to handle some of the data and link the laboratory practical and informatics strands.  Students will have the ability to access a formative interactive on-line practical that they can perform as many times as they wish individually or as a study group prior to the on-line assessment.  Online support will be available via Zoom by the lecturer.

Statistics strand D:
A close integration between didactic lectures and practical sessions in an IT cluster allow students to immediately apply theoretical knowledge. Each week students get a 1 hr lecture released on one aspect of numerical data analysis (K2) followed by a 1 hr practical class in which commercially available statistical software will be used (S5). The sequence of topics develops an appreciation of statistics and an introductory competence in their use.","Practical strand (Total 40%: Exam) 

On practical techniques and laboratory practical 1,2, supplementary practical  and 3. On-line and automatically marked worksheets comprising mainly quiz format questions will be used to provide feedback and self-evaluation of student's understanding of the laboratory practicals. The material taught in this strand will also be examined as part of Written Examination 1 (see Assessment tables). 


Ethics strand (Total 20%: Coursework) 

The ethics strand consists of the seven ethics lectures, the essay question-based seminar and the opportunity to be involved with 2 synchronous discussions. This strand will be assessed by a written assignment (1000 words total part b). The title will reflect key ethical dilemmas (choice of one of three). Instructions will be provided at the introduction session and in a pre-recorded session. The assignment will provide students with the opportunity to reflect on an ethical issue. 


Informatics strand (Total 20%: Coursework) 

The informatics strand consists of the Informatics lectures, along with the Informatics training session. Assessment consists of a  online computer assessment (short answer questions) which will test an individual student’s ability to find and interpret informatics data. The format will be almost identical to that undertaken as the formative informatics on-line practical. 


Statistics strand (Total 20%: Coursework) 

The statistics strand consists of 5 lectures (pre-recorded) and 5 in person sessions as outlined in the Teaching Activities table. The assessment consists of written worksheets and on-line assessment (short answer questions). A unique set of data for each student generated from their student ID number is used to test the student’s ability to apply appropriate statistical methods and interpret the results (NUMBAS will be used).

•Develop their global citizenship and intercultural competence through studying abroad

•Reflect upon their learning style through recording their experiences and development throughout the year 

•Study a broader range of modules than available in the standard length degree 

•Build their resilience and adaptability through new experiences and methods of studying

•Develop, where appropriate, new language skills

•Prepare students effectively for studying at stage 3 by enhancing their breadth of academic experience",,,,,,"Students will experience teaching at partner institutions and the methods will vary according to the modules studied.


Study placements are planned to go ahead in 2021-22, but cannot be guaranteed due to the potential of cancellations of programmes by partner institutions, entry restrictions of host countries and the University’s travel policy (taking into account H&S considerations and Insurance guidance), which may not allow travel to certain countries to go ahead. 

If study placements cannot go ahead, students can either interrupt their studies for a year (if they wish to undertake the placement in the following year) or continue with their next stage of studies at Newcastle University on the original degree programme (without placement). 

An inverted study option (undertaking the placement after the final year) may be offered at the discretion of the School but students will need to reapply for a study place in the following year and a place at a partner institution cannot be guaranteed.  

If the study placement can go ahead, students have to complete all mandatory pre-departure training sessions and read relevant materials, complete their risk assessment and sign the ‘Conditions of Participation’ form in Terra Dotta before receiving final approval to go abroad. However, placements may be cancelled at any time (even after receiving the final approval) or students may be recalled from their placement if they are already abroad if the situation in the host country changes and the University decides that it is no longer safe for the student to stay in the host country. 

All students will be contacted by the module leader every other week by e-mail and will be invited to monthly virtual meetings with the Exchange Coordinator to monitor progress.

It focuses on how psychological principles may be applied to understand and alleviate problems of illness, suboptimal-health and health-related behaviours at various levels, from individual to group to population. Both initiation and maintenance of health behaviours will be covered, and the practical effectiveness of some theoretical approaches considered. Practical consultation skills in health behaviour change will be introduced and developed using simulations and role plays. The psychology of typical and ‘abnormal’ eating will be explored, including a consideration of health behaviours and long-term health conditions encountered in clinical practice.",,,,,,"Present in person interactive lectures and informal classroom discussions and tests present a systematic perspective on the topics, allow students to check their knowledge and understanding as they go, and prompt deeper consideration of, and debate around, key psychological issues in clinical dietetic practice. Three sets of non-synchronous material will require students to engage with lecture materials and recorded interviews with academic subject experts, then engage in guided discussion threads on the topic.

Present in person small group workshops will prompt students to apply knowledge from lectures to hypothetical patient case studies of incrementally-increasing complexity. This provides the opportunity to practice key skills for the summative case assessment as well as demonstrating the wide-ranging applicability of the knowledge gained. Workshops will also allow students to share peer-feedback on rough plans for their summative assignment.

Independent study time will be used to prepare the summative assessment and undertake directed research and reading, in order to consolidate expected knowledge and skills.","Summative:

In the 1500-word summative case study, students will be expected to propose and justify their approach to health behaviour change for one of two possible hypothetical patients (individual student’s choice, vignettes provided). They will be expected to consider (i) the biopsychosocial factors affecting the patient’s eating behaviour, (ii) any long-term conditions, and (iii) appropriate approaches to the communication of risk. Students will then set out practical psychological approaches and strategies for supporting the patient in behaviour change and maintenance.  This component will give students the opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they have acquired during the module in the application of behaviour change theories and psychological knowledge about eating behaviours.

Formative:
Throughout the module’s workshops students will engage in role play activities, complete reflections, and have the opportunity to engage in discussions that will help support summative coursework development.

•Prepare students effectively for studying at stage 3 by enhancing their breadth of academic experience",,,,,,"Students will experience teaching at partner institutions and the methods will vary according to the modules studied.



Study placements are planned to go ahead in 2021-22, but cannot be guaranteed due to the potential of cancellations of programmes by partner institutions, entry restrictions of host countries and the University’s travel policy (taking into account H&S considerations and Insurance guidance), which may not allow travel to certain countries to go ahead. 

If study placements cannot go ahead, students can either interrupt their studies for a year (if they wish to undertake the placement in the following year) or continue with their next stage of studies at Newcastle University on the original degree programme (without placement). 

An inverted study option (undertaking the placement after the final year) may be offered at the discretion of the School but students will need to reapply for a study place in the following year and a place at a partner institution cannot be guaranteed.  

If the study placement can go ahead, students have to complete all mandatory pre-departure training sessions and read relevant materials, complete their risk assessment and sign the ‘Conditions of Participation’ form in Terra Dotta before receiving final approval to go abroad. However, placements may be cancelled at any time (even after receiving the final approval) or students may be recalled from their placement if they are already abroad if the situation in the host country changes and the University decides that it is no longer safe for the student to stay in the host country. 

All students will be contacted by the module leader every other week by e-mail and will be invited to monthly virtual meetings with the Exchange Coordinator to monitor progress.

•Build their resilience and adaptability through new experiences and methods of studying

•Develop, where appropriate, new language skills

•Prepare students effectively for studying at stage 3 by enhancing their breadth of academic experience",,,,,,"Students will experience teaching at partner institutions and the methods will vary according to the modules studied.



Study placements are planned to go ahead in 2021-22, but cannot be guaranteed due to the potential of cancellations of programmes by partner institutions, entry restrictions of host countries and the University’s travel policy (taking into account H&S considerations and Insurance guidance), which may not allow travel to certain countries to go ahead. 

If study placements cannot go ahead, students can either interrupt their studies for a year (if they wish to undertake the placement in the following year) or continue with their next stage of studies at Newcastle University on the original degree programme (without placement). 

An inverted study option (undertaking the placement after the final year) may be offered at the discretion of the School but students will need to reapply for a study place in the following year and a place at a partner institution cannot be guaranteed.  

If the study placement can go ahead, students have to complete all mandatory pre-departure training sessions and read relevant materials, complete their risk assessment and sign the ‘Conditions of Participation’ form in Terra Dotta before receiving final approval to go abroad. However, placements may be cancelled at any time (even after receiving the final approval) or students may be recalled from their placement if they are already abroad if the situation in the host country changes and the University decides that it is no longer safe for the student to stay in the host country. 

All students will be contacted by the module leader every other week by e-mail and will be invited to monthly virtual meetings with the Exchange Coordinator to monitor progress. This will allow for any changes in study activities caused by pandemic to be considered, and if necessary, the mode of learning can be adjusted.","The module is a pass / fail based on the completion of the above components.

The key skill is abstraction (leaving out details to focus on key properties). The principal aim of this module is to communicate this skill.

In order to record models, it is necessary to use some notation. There are several notations, and they tend to have areas of application. If the notation is well thought out, it makes it possible to reason about properties of the described system; If there is mechanical support, one can both exercise the model and draw verified conclusions.

 The range of applications of interest range from simple components to aircraft collision avoidance.

A particular focus will be on recording the meaning (semantics) of programming languages.
Programming languages come and go - if you make a career in computing, there is no doubt that you will have to learn languages which do not even exist today. In addition to literally thousands of existing general purpose languages, there are languages tailored for specific applications, such as gaming, virtual reality, text layout, robotics. Sadly, many languages embody one new idea (e.g. objects, concurrency, remote execution), but are significantly *worse* than their predecessors in other respects. 

A key aim of this module is to communicate ways of understanding and documenting the main ideas in a language. The material should equip you to make sense of the many languages you will meet in your career. If you design new languages, they will benefit from you being able to manipulate the key concepts.

Furthermore, to make sure the complexities (and scale) of language design are addressed, you will also be trained in practical aspects of formal modelling and verification. For this we will use a well- founded approach following a set of mature formal tools and techniques within software engineering",,,,,,Lectures are used to impart knowledge and practicals are used to provide experience of the solution of problems and understanding of decisions in practice.,"The unseen examination will allow assessment of acquired knowledge using short bookwork questions, the ability to apply that knowledge using application questions, & time-constrained assessment of subject-specific skills using application questions.

Summary:
Put simply, structural engineers design buildings and infrastructure for structural sufficiency. This module is the first in a series of structural design modules where students learn to do this. The module introduces students to the principles of limit states design and discusses the relevant limiting states and how these are derived. The module then describes the theory behind the structural models used to determine if a structure is structurally sound. In this module, design is limited to simple element design; however the relationship between element design and building system design is introduced. Construction issues are also discussed and some of these are demonstrated with a series of practical classes where full sized steel beams, concrete beams and steel columns are tested to destruction. Analyses of test results help to reinforce the theory. Finally students are introduced to relevant Codes of Practice for designing structures.",,,,,,"This subject is a professional, design type subject and as such the teaching tries to simulate a work environment as closely as possible. Teaching and learning is mainly through lectures and design examples. Students are encouraged to practise example problems at home and to do further reading. Solutions to these problems are given in the lectures. Practical classes help to introduce practical aspects of structural design and analyses of test results from these practical classes help to reinforce the theory.  Small group teaching activities are run to give students the opportunity to further their understanding and solve examples.","The learning outcomes from this module are absolutely essential if students are to become chartered structural engineers. As such it is important that the material is not only understood, but can be quickly applied in a variety of situations. A closed book unseen exam is the best way of assessing if the students have achieved this.

The practical work is meant to help students link the simplifying assumptions used in the design of steel and concrete elements with the real phenomena. Students are given time to do this then tested with formative feedback in practical session before being assessed via PC examination based on practical results.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/sage/engineering/,

Module summary

Virtually every branch of mathematics and statistics can be developed only from a firm foundation.  These skills form the toolkit required for further study. 

A clear understanding and appreciation of many fundamental topics is required, primarily, those of algebra and calculus.

This module concentrates on the foundations of calculus.  Of course, understanding alone is not sufficient: considerable manipulative skill is an essential ingredient if progress is to be made.  This module provides a basis for all this, by building on the ideas explored in A-level (or equivalent) studies, with the ideas rehearsed - often in a different, but more complete way.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.  Problem Classes are used to help develop the students’ abilities at applying the theory to solving problems.","A substantial formal unseen examination is appropriate for the assessment of the material in this module.

Module summary

This module, which continues and extends the work of MAS1605, develops many of the ideas that are needed when constructing mathematical models of phenomena in the real world. Many such models are formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations, and this module introduces the methods that are needed to solve problems of this type. The world where we live is multi-dimensional - three-dimensional if we consider spatial dimensions alone, or four-dimensional if we treat time as another variable. It is therefore essential to develop tools to describe and model objects and processes that occur in multi-dimensional spaces.  In order to do this we require multidimensional calculus.  This module introduces the partial derivative, and the multiple integral, as well as power series in two or more variables.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module outline
In mathematics and physics, dynamics is the study of movement and change over time, in ways that can be described by mathematical equations or systems of equations. The aim is to explain and predict past and future patterns using basic principles of mathematics. Objects of interest might be tiny particles or huge stars, there might be a single object or very many. 
Working from a mathematical point of view, we will formulate problems in terms of functions which can be differentiated or integrated, so essentially working with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In modern mathematical usage, ‘dynamics’ describes the analysis of such ODEs. This will involve methods you’ve met (or are meeting) in other modules. We’ll focus on problems of idealised 'point particles' (simple bodies) and describe their motion when they are thrown or shot (ballistic), oscillating or orbiting something (circular and elliptical orbits).",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module summary

The idea of solving an equation like x^2+1 = 0, by inventing a new number to represent the square root of -1, can be traced back at least as far as Egyptian pyramid builders in 1850 BC. From the need to solve such problems the idea of complex numbers, z = x + iy, arose, and happily the rich geometric and analytic theory of these numbers allows simple and elegant solutions to otherwise difficult or insoluble problems.
The important and exciting ideas emerge when we consider functions f(z) of a complex variable z. These functions turn out to have surprising and dramatic properties that are quite unexpected, when compared with functions of real variables (the case when z is a real number). Indeed, the natural view of many common functions, for example exponential and trigonometric functions, is in the complex plane. We shall introduce elementary functions in the complex plane, study their continuity and differentiability, and then move to the extraordinary results that follow when we investigate integration.

Integration in the complex plane involves the notion of a line integral, but surprisingly, many calculations can be reduced to a simple algebraic exercise; something which is quite counter-intuitive, and a great relief to those accustomed to conventional integration of real functions! Indeed, these methods can be used to tackle, very simply, many integrals that are difficult if approached using standard methods.
The theory of complex variables, plays a crucial role in many branches of mathematics and science; for example, in algebraic geometry, number theory, complex dynamics and fractals, fluid mechanics, string theory and electrical engineering.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module summary

The concept of a field is a natural one since we have a familiar structure with two operations which mimic addition and multiplication of numbers. We study examples of finite fields. We consider polynomials defined over a field and means of determining reducibility or irreducibility in some cases. We find that polynomials over a field form a system known as a ring and we consider the possibility of factorisation in a ring.

Module Summary 

Linear algebra is a fundamental subject that pervades many areas of modern mathematics. On the one hand it is often convenient to replace a complicated problem by a linear approximation which is easier to solve. On the other hand, linear algebra has beautiful applications in coding theory, projective geometry, and many other areas of mathematics and statistics. Initially linear algebra aims to solve systems of linear equations. In the first-year courses this led naturally to matrix algebra. In the first half of this module abstraction and generalisation are pushed one level further with the formal introduction of vector spaces and linear maps as a replacement for real n-dimensional space and matrices, respectively. This allows us to consider analogous problems in different settings simultaneously and eventually makes explanations easier and faster. We will need to introduce notions of dimension and basis in this general setting. A guiding question is how to transform matrices (or linear maps) to a simple form in which essential properties can be immediately read off. 
In the second half, groups will be introduced, and their basic properties will be studied via permutation groups, building on knowledge of mappings and permutations. The concept of an algorithm will be introduced and formally defined, with some discussion on how the complexity of an algorithm can be measured. The basic notation of graphs will be introduced, some well-known problems will be formulated in that language. Solutions to the problem will be discussed, as well as their complexities.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module Summary 

Fluid dynamics plays a central role in many natural phenomena. As we breathe, gas flows in and out of our lungs, whilst our heart pumps blood around the body. Without a proper understanding of large-scale fluid flows in the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, it would be impossible for meteorologists to produce reliable weather forecasts. On yet larger scales, the complex motions in the Earth’s molten iron core are responsible for sustaining the terrestrial magnetic field. The principles of fluid dynamics can also be used to explain aerodynamic lift, whilst engineers need to be able to model fluid flows around solid bodies (like tall buildings) and along pipes.    

This module will introduce the concept of a fluid, and the ways in which the motions of such a system can be described. The main focus of this module will be on the dynamics of inviscid (frictionless) fluids. Even with such an assumption, it is not possible to write down a general solution of the governing equations, but it is possible to make certain simplifying assumptions to deduce the properties of certain flows. In many respects, this module is a sequel to vector calculus (MAS2801).

Module Summary

Many applications of mathematics involve objects and quantities that exist in multiple dimensions, as well as their rates of change in space and/or time. This course shows how calculus can be applied to such problems, and introduces techniques for solving the resulting differential equations.

The first half of this module explains how we can mathematically define curves and surfaces in three-dimensional space, and how we can calculate their properties, such as tangent, length and area. We also introduce the concepts of scalar fields (e.g. temperature, pressure, density) and vector fields (e.g. velocity and electromagnetic fields). To describe these objects and quantities we must generalize the principles of calculus to multi-dimensions. This part of the course introduces the mathematical language and concepts that are needed to study continuous media, fluids, and electromagnetism.

The second half of this module continues the exploration of differential equation that started in Stage 1, with emphasis on methods to solve them, both exact and approximate. The essential elements in the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations, and their methods of solution, introduced in this module, provide the basis for specific studies in other modules.

Students will learn about the use of linear models to build statistical descriptions of data and about the use of simple probability distributions to provide useful models for many applications. Students will be able to use regression analysis in some simple cases; they will be able to apply Poisson Processes to model relevant random processes

Module summary

Statistics aims to learn about populations on the basis of samples drawn from them. Population parameters, such as means, can be estimated by suitable sample statistics, but they will be in error because of sample to sample variation. Statistical inference is concerned both with estimating parameters and also with quantifying the associated sampling variation. 
This module introduces fundamental notions of a standard error, confidence interval and hypothesis tests, in the context of both discrete and continuous variables. The likelihood is probably the most important concept in statistical methodology, and its introduction in the case of a scalar parameter is one of the main features of the module.

The module will also introduce students to two distinct areas of stochastic modelling. One part will broaden the students' knowledge of statistical inference  by introducing the linear model. This will start with a simple regression for a scalar covariate, moving to an introductory treatment of a matrix-based approach for a model with more covariates. The other part will be to use the Poisson process as an example of a model for a process of events occurring randomly in time. The main properties of the homogenous Poisson process will be derived, and necessary tools, such as probability and moment generating functions, will be studied.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module Summary

Around the end of the 19th century, mathematicians began to realise that the methods used to solve differential equations are in some ways similar to those involved in solving simultaneous equations. They soon began to investigate this similarity carefully. The topic of this course grew out of an attempt to provide a rigorous framework within which to explain phenomena in applied mathematics. One needs linear algebra to explain the matrix behaviour, and analysis to explain the calculus. The result is the concept of a Banach space, a structure in which we have vectors and a notion of size, and operators, which in many ways are just like matrices.

Matrices play a key role in mathematics with many applications to pure, statistics and physics. They are necessary in almost every area of science, whether it be mathematics, economics, engineering or operational research. Matrix analysis provides a common framework to this effect. It allows the development of design tools and algorithms that solve efficiently linear systems, polynomial matrix equations, optimization problems, as well as problems that arise in quantum information theory.

Module Summary

Topology is an elegant and abstract subject that arose from disparate sources but is now fundamental in analysis and geometry. One way of viewing topology is to say it answers the question: what are the last features of a subset on n-dimensional Euclidean space to discover when one progressively deforms space? Another approach would be through the question: what do the many limiting procedures in mathematics have in common? It turns out that just three axioms are enough to produce a rich subject which provides the right setting in which to understand both the local aspects of sets and mappings (such as continuity) and the global aspects (such as the overall nature of a set).",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

To show how Number Theory and Group Theory play an important role in communication in the modern world.

Module Summary

The more one examines the properties and inter-relationships of the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,... the more interesting they become. The early Greeks knew about primes and perfect numbers. Since those days many of the most famous mathematicians have worked hard to prove results about the natural numbers, and while doing so have invented techniques and crystallized definitions that have influenced the development of many branches of pure mathematics. Results in number theory are often easy to understand and state, for example ""find a formula for the number pi(x) of primes less than x, or at least a good approximation (the prime number theorem)"", or ""the probability that two positive integers are relatively prime is 6/pi ^2 "".
Security, confidentiality and authentication are of great significance in the age of electronic communication. Cryptography is the means of achieving these aims. We shall look at some of the fundamental symmetric ciphers, these are fast and efficient to implement but have a weakness in that both parties need to know the key. We shall study code-breaking techniques for such ciphers and see how ways of combining ciphers reduces vulnerability to such techniques. We shall look at public key cryptography (asymmetric ciphers), where anyone can encipher a message but only the key holder can decipher it. Such ciphers are relatively slow but avoid the need for a key to be exchanged between the parties. In practice, public key cryptography can be used to transmit the key of a good symmetric cipher, so both symmetric and asymmetric ciphers play important roles. We shall look at the idea of a digital signature, a means of verifying the identity of the sender of an electronic message. Most ciphers are based on mathematical constructions from Number Theory, Group Theory and Geometry. We shall concentrate largely on applications of Number Theory. We shall use a few ideas from Group Theory but no prior knowledge is necessary.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

It was soon noticed that many very similar – often identical – equations arise in many and varied applications, all with correspondingly similar solutions and methods of solution. This module continues the study of differential equations undertaken at Stage 2, bringing all these ideas together, developing more general methods for first-order PDEs and touching on, and extending, the ideas of separation of variables for second-order PDEs.

Module summary 

Why can you hang an umbrella from a hook, but not stand it on its point? Why do some fluid flows remain smooth while others become turbulent? Linear stability theory provides a mathematical framework to answer such questions.

The time-evolution of innumerable real-world systems can be described using mathematical models, but the resulting equations can be complicated and nonlinear. Often there are no general solutions. Nonetheless, linear stability theory provides a way to determine whether a particular steady state of the system is stable against small perturbations. The theory also provides insight into the nature of the systems of equations themselves, and highlights profound connections between the theory of differential equations and linear algebra.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module summary

More data than ever before are being generated and stored, in a variety of fields such as healthcare and e-commerce. The term “big data” has emerged in acknowledgement of the vast amounts of data now available. By applying statistical analyses to these data sets, we can start to use them to answer important questions, for example, which genetic markers are associated with incidence of a particular disease. Commonly the data sets that arise are multivariate, comprising a large number of observations on many variables. In this module we study how we can learn from data sets of this form. We begin by considering their representation in R, and techniques for generating numerical and graphical summaries. We then turn to consider more formal techniques - often branded ""unsupervised learning"" - intended to summarise the relationships between variables or observations. Finally we consider a collection of inferential procedures - so-called ""supervised learning"" techniques - where the goal is to predict a categorical or quantitative response variable on the basis of a collection of covariates.

The modelling of many biological and physical systems is often naturally done in continuous time. If we also wish to model the uncertainty inherent in the system, then we need a family of stochastic processes which evolve in continuous time. Markov processes are the most important such family and have been widely used. Applications include modelling outbreaks of infectious disease, complex biological networks and even exchange rates.

University of Newcastle,NU,Mathematics and Statistics,Discrete Stochastic Modelling,10,Dr Aamir Khan,"To gain an understanding of some of the areas of stochastic modelling in discrete time that underpin quantitative descriptions of population growth, epidemics and the analysis of DNA sequences

Module summary
Many random processes can be thought of as evolving through a sequence of successive generations. For example, population growth depends on which individuals successfully produce offspring in the next generation; the transmission of a disease through a population depends on how individuals interact from day to day. Models which incorporate random variation allow prediction of important quantities such as the size of a population or duration of an epidemic, as well as variability in these estimates. This module presents techniques for modelling such processes with applications drawn in particular from the biological sciences. Branching processes will be introduced as a means of modelling population growth. Stochastic models which describe epidemic growth by considering the size of the infected and immune subpopulations will then be studied. These have been important in recent years for the analysis of influenza and other epidemics.
DNA sequences can be considered as strings of letters from the four-letter alphabet {A,C,G,T}. Markov chains provide a useful stochastic model to describe the probability of the letter at the next
site in the sequence given the letter at the current site. However, the presence of genes and other functional elements within a sequence suggest that more sophisticated models are required, in particular, models which allow these transition probabilities to vary along the length of the sequence. Originally developed for automatic speech recognition, hidden Markov models have proved to be a remarkably flexible and powerful model for automatic segmentation and gene-finding in DNA sequences. As their name suggests, hidden Markov models are based on an unobserved Markov chain. Methods for estimating this ""hidden"" Markov chain will be considered. Computational algorithms will be developed in R.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module Summary

A time series is a set of ordered data with respect to time, such as the carbon dioxide concentration at a specific location measured at noon each day or the sales of a product recorded each month. Often in statistics, data are regarded as independent draws from a population. In time series analysis we typically do not regard consecutive observations to be independent, and build models to represent this dependence. Time series exhibit features such as trends and seasonal, or periodic, behaviour. In this module we consider modelling and inference for time series and forecasting future observations.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module summary
There are many areas where interest focuses on data which measures the time to some event. In recent decades the principal application for such data has been how long patients survive before some event occurs. The event may be death or it may be the recurrence of a disease which had been in remission, or some other event. Applications are not solely medical: how long it takes a battery to run down or how long a component in a machine lasts before it fails are just two industrial examples. Such data are known as survival data, or sometimes lifetime data, and their analysis is called survival analysis. The main complication with survival data is that many observations will be ‘censored’, i.e. they are only partially observed. For example, when a trial of a new treatment for cancer is terminated many of the patients will still be alive. Therefore the survival times of those who died will be known exactly whereas for those still alive at the end of the trial, their survival time is only known to exceed their present survival. Methods for dealing with this form of data will be considered.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module summary

The first part of this module is concerned with building and applying statistical models for data. How does a mixture of quantitative and qualitative variables affect the body mass index of an individual? Suppose we find an association between age and body mass index, how can we study if this association varies between men and women, or between those with different educational backgrounds? In this course we consider the issues involved when we wish to construct realistic and useful statistical models for problems which can arise in a range of fields: medicine, finance, social research and environmental issues being some of the main areas.
We revise multiple linear regression models, and see how they are special cases of a General Linear Model. We move on to consider Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as another special case of a general linear model – this is the problem of investigating contrasts between different levels of a factor in affecting a response and then we generalize to the case of several factors. We consider Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) which involves mixing linear regression and factor effects, and the idea of interaction between explanatory variables in the way they affect a response. The module provides a comprehensive introduction to the issues involved in using statistics to model real data, and to draw relevant conclusions. There is an emphasis on hands-on application of the theory and methods throughout, with extensive use of R.

The second part of the module builds on the first part (Linear Modelling) by introducing a generalized framework of models which allow us to generalize away from Normally distributed errors to different kinds of random outcomes, building in an appropriate transformation of the linear function of explanatory variables to match. We note that the general linear models studied in the first part of the module exist as a special case. 

We generalize linear models to study the topic of Generalized Linear Models, allowing us to build non-linear relationships into our models, and to study many different types of outcome measure which could not have been handled using general linear models. We consider asymptotic maximum likelihood estimation for the multi-parameter case, including the use of information matrices in parameter estimation and likelihood ratio tests for comparing nested models. These ideas are applied to Generalized Linear Models. We study in depth the special cases involved with Binomial outcomes, logistic regression, where we are interested in how explanatory variables affect the success rate, and then log-linear models, which enable us to study among other things, contingency tables involving more than two factors. 

This module opens up the possibility to study many kinds of real life situations which were inaccessible to linear models, allowing us to study many realistic and important problems.

To develop an understanding of the statistical theory underpinning methods and models for the analysis of “big” and, in particular, multivariate data. To gain experience in the application of this theory to a large data set.

Module summary

The course builds on the foundations of inference laid in MAS2901. A variety of types of methods for inference for models with multiple parameters are established, including asymptotic methods for large samples, exact methods and computer-intensive approaches.

More data than ever before are being generated and stored, in a variety of fields such as healthcare and e-commerce. The term “big data” has emerged in acknowledgement of the vast amounts of data now available. By applying statistical analyses to these data sets, we can start to use them to answer important questions, for example, which genetic markers are associated with incidence of a particular disease. Commonly the data sets that arise are multivariate, comprising a large number of observations on many variables. In this module we study how we can learn from data sets of this form. We begin by considering their representation in R, and techniques for generating numerical and graphical summaries. We then turn to consider more formal techniques - often branded ""unsupervised learning"" - intended to summarise the relationships between variables or observations. Finally we consider a collection of inferential procedures - so-called ""supervised learning"" techniques - where the goal is to predict a categorical or quantitative response variable on the basis of a collection of covariates. In the latter case, we study linear regression, focusing on overcoming the problems that arise when confronted with a very large number of covariates.",,,,,,"Non-synchronous online materials are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on assessed work.

Module outline
In mathematics and physics, dynamics is the study of movement and change over time, in ways that can be described by mathematical equations or systems of equations. The aim is to explain and predict past and future patterns using basic principles of mathematics. Objects of interest might be tiny particles or huge stars, there might be a single object or very many. 
Working from a mathematical point of view, we will formulate problems in terms of functions which can be differentiated or integrated, so essentially working with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In modern mathematical usage, ‘dynamics’ describes the analysis of such ODEs. This will involve methods you’ve met (or are meeting) in other modules.

Module Summary

Quantum mechanics is the theoretical framework used to describe the most fundamental properties of matter. It has a rich mathematical structure and it has provided the impetus for many advances in mathematics. It also has many practical applications, including the modelling of atoms, molecules and semiconductors. Recently, quantum theory has been used extensively to model superfluids and supercooled gases, and there are even attempts to build computers which function by the laws of quantum mechanics.

This module discusses the wave formulation of quantum mechanics in the context of the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation, which is mathematically solved in various trapped problems, including box and quadratic potentials, and open-boundary cases. The course introduces the more mathematical aspects of quantum mechanics including its formal structure based on the fundamental postulates, and the role and importance of operator algebra in describing such systems.

Module Summary 

Fluid dynamics plays a central role in many natural phenomena. As we breathe, gas flows in and out of our lungs, whilst our heart pumps blood around the body. Without a proper understanding of large-scale fluid flows in the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, it would be impossible for meteorologists to produce reliable weather forecasts. On yet larger scales, the complex motions in the Earth’s molten iron core are responsible for sustaining the terrestrial magnetic field. The principles of fluid dynamics can also be used to explain aerodynamic lift, whilst engineers need to be able to model fluid flows around solid bodies (like tall buildings) and along pipes.    

This module will introduce the concept of a fluid, and the ways in which the motions of such a system can be described. The main focus of this module will be on the dynamics of inviscid (frictionless) fluids. Even with such an assumption, it is not possible to write down a general solution of the governing equations, but it is possible to make certain simplifying assumptions to deduce the properties of certain flows.

Module Summary

Many applications of mathematics involve objects and quantities that exist in multiple dimensions, as well as their rates of change in space and/or time. This course shows how calculus can be applied to such problems, and introduces techniques for solving the resulting differential equations.

The first half of this module explains how we can mathematically define curves and surfaces in three-dimensional space, and how we can calculate their properties, such as tangent, length and area. We also introduce the concepts of scalar fields (e.g. temperature, pressure, density) and vector fields (e.g. velocity and electromagnetic fields). To describe these objects and quantities we must generalize the principles of calculus to multi-dimensions. This part of the course introduces the mathematical language and concepts that are needed to study continuous media, fluids, and electromagnetism.

The second half of this module continues the exploration of differential equation that started in Stage 1, with emphasis on methods to solve them, both exact and approximate. The essential elements in the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations, and their methods of solution, introduced in this module, provide the basis for specific studies in other modules.

Module Summary

What is the shortest route between two places on the Earth's surface (the answer isn't a straight line, because the Earth isn't flat!)? How to run a utilitarian economy? How do you reformulate dynamical motion in terms of geometry? To answer questions such as these, we need a way to find the path between two points which minimises some quantity (such as length or time). The calculus of variations is a very elegant and powerful way of doing this, and consequently has wide application to real-world problems. The ideas provide the basis for a reformulation of dynamics which underpins modern theoretical physics.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

Module Summary
Almost all studies of physical phenomena lead to partial differential equations (PDEs), which have been studied for over 250 years; they are at the heart of modern applied mathematics, physics and engineering. It was soon noticed that many very similar – often identical – equations arise in many and varied applications, all with correspondingly similar solutions and methods of solution. This module continues the study of differential equations undertaken at Stage 2, bringing all these ideas together, developing more general methods for first-order PDEs and touching on, and extending, the ideas of separation of variables for second-order PDEs. In addition, some of the standard results and theorems relating to classical PDEs will also be discussed. Examples of these equations, and methods of solution, will be taken from various practical, relevant and important applications.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

University of Newcastle,NU,Mathematics and Statistics,Instabilities,10,Dr Magda Carr,"To introduce linear stability theory, and demonstrate how it can be used it to understand the behaviour of mathematical models representing real-world systems, particularly in the field of fluid mechanics.

Module summary 

Why can you hang an umbrella from a hook, but not stand it on its point? Why do some fluid flows remain smooth while others become turbulent? Linear stability theory provides a mathematical framework to answer such questions.

The time-evolution of innumerable real-world systems can be described using mathematical models, but the resulting equations can be complicated and nonlinear. Often there are no general solutions. Nonetheless, linear stability theory provides a way to determine whether a particular steady state of the system is stable against small perturbations. The theory also provides insight into the nature of the systems of equations themselves, and highlights profound connections between the theory of differential equations and linear algebra.",,,,,,"Lectures are used for the delivery of theory and explanation of methods, illustrated with examples, and for giving general feedback on marked work.

University of Newcastle,NU,Natural and Environmental Sciences,Marketing and Public Policy,10,Dr Diogo Monjardino De Souza Monteiro,"Public policy is a field of politics and governance aiming to understand how to rule. It has been defined as “a strategic action led by a public authority in order to limit or increase the presence of certain phenomena within the population” (National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy (NCCHPP), 2012). There are several views on what is and is not public policy. It is beyond the scope of this module to debate on what is policy. Rather, after a brief discussion of what is public policy, this module will focus on the opportunities and limitations of using the marketing framework as a policy instrument. In other words, we aim to introduce marketing as way to define strategies to achieve policy outcomes. For example, smoke cessation could be viewed as meriting public policy interventions. Note however, that marketing is mainly a business tool to encourage consumers to purchase products or services they need. So, marketing can be also an object of policy, for example by restricting opening hours of supermarkets to support small shops or forbidding promoting alcohol consumption to children. How can we define a policy based on the marketing framework to address smoke cessation? We could conceive a strategy that would include Pricing (through taxation); Distribution (restricting places where tobacco is sold); Product (limiting the amount of nicotine allowed or banning sales to under 20 year olds); Communications (public information campaigns, social media, campaigns, advertising restrictions) etc. Typically the desired outcome of a strategic action or mechanism is a change in the behaviour of consumers and/or businesses. 
In general, sound policy making requires an evidence base approach upon which policies are founded, prioritised and evaluated. Marketing can contribute evidence in all these areas, including the identification of 'unintended consequences'. Marketing therefore has much to contribute to contemporary issues of public interest. However, marketing practices are also criticised for contributing to over-consumption and unethical practices.
Clearly public policy is a complex issue and can be examined (and taught) from different angles and perspectives. The aim of this class is to raise your awareness of how public policy is formulated and implemented as well as what is the role of marketing in public policy. In this class you will be taught by case study or policy issue. So, the instructors will proposed a policy topic (typically one they have or are researching), suggest readings and encourage you learn by doing. We will discuss different policy instruments and examine some concrete examples of public policies and discuss their implications for stakeholders.

The module is based on transferable employability and research skills and students will achieve the learning outcomes through full engagement with the opportunities provided by the subject-specific work-related learning placement. 

Tutorial sessions will allow students to meet with their Tutor in small groups to further enhance key skills and concepts developed in taught practical sessions and during independent study. Drop-in clinics will allow students to receive one-on-one support for any aspect of the module. 

The independent project proposal allows the student to demonstrate their planning and organisational skills (including a GANTT chart to make clearly the programme of research). 

Directed research and reading will support the information received through formal practicals and tutorials by guided independent study using primary literature and key texts. Students will be encouraged to become more independent in their learning at this stage in their programmes to develop key skills such as Active Learning, Goal Setting and Action Planning, Decision Making, and Initiative, which they will require at Levels 6. 

Assessment preparation and completion will allow students to fully prepare for their formative and summative coursework. They will have the opportunity to consolidate and build upon knowledge gained in the taught sessions.","Students will be expected to undertake formative assessment to develop their CV and covering letter writing skills 
with feedback from the teaching team. These documents will be submitted to the work-related learning provider to 
present students with experience of an application process. 

The work placement plan will be discussed and developed with the teaching team and placement supervisor to support students in developing timely and deliverable objectives to be undertaken during the placement and to help the take responsibility for their role during the placement. The work placement plan will be reviewed during semester two to help students reflect upon and evaluate their progress against the stated outcomes. Students will be able to incorporate feedback from this into their reflective log. 

Upon completion of the subject-specific work-related learning placement students are expected to complete a written reflective assessment of their experience. To complete this, students are expected to maintain a formative reflective record throughout the module using the ePortfolio tool. The written assessment will allow students to present and discuss their personal and professional learning and development in relation to the Graduate Framework and will incorporate relevant literature on personal development. 

The Library Project essays will combine both summative and formative assessment. In semester 1 students will undertake formative exercises to allow them to develop their critical evaluation skills. Students will submit two short essays on the same question, with each essay covering different aspects of essay writing. This will lead on from the summative essay assessment in MST1204 Academic and Professional Skills for the Biosciences. Upon completion of the formative essays in semester 1, students will choose their own Library Project topic and produce an essay plan to be discussed with their Tutor. Students will receive formative feedback on their essay plan to allow them to develop a suitable structure and content for the summatively assessed essay. Students will then complete the summatively assessed essay using skills from the formative assessment. 

The oral presentation requires students to summarise their summative Library Project essay. Students will give an overview of their topic and present current knowledge of the area in relation to the primary scientific literature. Their use of visual aids, the structure of the presentation, the level of scientific information, and their presentation style will be assessed. 

This is a very skill driven module with the need for continued hands-on experience of designing experiments, manipulating data sets and choosing and using the appropriate statistical tests for data analysis. Formative PC and worksheet based assessments will provide students with the opportunity to develop and use new found skills. The summative PC test will test student’s ability to retain key information and apply it appropriately to new situations.",https://www.ncl.ac.uk/,http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mobility/experience-newcastle/sage/nes/,
University of Newcastle,NU,Natural and Environmental Sciences,Marine Practical Skills II,20,Dr Guenther Uher,"To build on the fundamental laboratory, boat work and research skills introduced at Level 4 in MST1205 Marine Practical Skills I. To equip students with the necessary practical skills and confidence in preparation for their Level 6 Research Project. To promote team work, decision making, project management and leadership skills. To provide training in good laboratory practice and health and safety, including completion of risk assessments and COSHH forms. 

This module will equip students with the practical skills necessary to become practicing professional marine scientists. The philosophy of this module is to train students to design and analyse experiments to answer specific hypotheses with an appropriate level of supervision. Emphasis will be placed on acquisition of numerical skills, risk assessment, teamwork and working to tight deadlines.",,,,,,"Lectures, laboratory practicals, fieldwork and workshops are designed to introduce the students to the theory behind the experimental protocol, discuss and analyse the data collected during the experiments and the techniques and skills used. Additional sessions on-board the research vessel will give students experience of conducting scientific data collection in a marine setting.  

Academic skills activities will utilise online content to allow students to prepare for their taught sessions. 

These sessions will provide students with a solid foundation and understanding of: 

• Practical and field methods in field marine biology, zoology and oceanography 

• Proposing, testing and challenging hypotheses 

• Data handling and processing 

• Concepts in marine community dynamics 

• Oceanographic survey methods 

The residential field course will extend students experience and knowledge of field based survey methodology and provide the opportunity for fundamental scientific skills to be developed. 

Directed research and reading will support the information received through formal practicals by guided independent study using primary literature and key texts. Students will be encouraged to become more independent in their learning at this stage in their programmes to develop key skills such as Active Learning, Goal Setting and Action 

Planning, Decision Making, and Initiative, which they will require at Levels 6.  

Assessment preparation and completion will allow students to fully prepare for their formative and summative coursework. Students will have the opportunity to consolidate and build upon knowledge gained in the taught sessions","The formative laboratory, field and research vessel assessments are designed to test the breadth of knowledge of important concepts related to designing and conducting scientific experiments and surveys using appropriate techniques and equipment. 

Assessment of laboratory and field classes will be summatively assessed through the completion of practical reports. These are designed to examine the student’s ability to present scientific information and data in a concise way while following a specific presentation format.
